               We demonstrate that Nazi indoctrination----with its singular
               focus on fostering racial hatred----was highly effective.
               Germans who grew up under the Nazi regime are much more
               anti-Semitic today than those born before or after that period.
               These findings demonstrate that beliefs can be modified
               massively through policy intervention. We also show that it was
               probably Nazi schooling that was most effective, and not radio
               or cinema propaganda. Where schooling could tap into preexisting
               prejudices, indoctrination was particularly strong. This

  author   = "Cardini, Andrea and O'Higgins, Paul and James Rohlf, F",
  abstract = "Abstract Using sampling experiments, we found that, when there
              are fewer groups than variables, between-groups PCA (bgPCA) may
              suggest surprisingly distinct differences among groups for data
              in which none exist. While apparently not noticed before, the
              reasons for this problem are easy to understand. A bgPCA captures
              the g-1 dimensions of variation among the g group means, but only
              a fraction of the dimensions of within-group variation (ni are
              the sample sizes), when the number of variables, p, are greater
              than g-1. This introduces a distortion in the appearance of the
              bgPCA plots because the within-group variation will be
              underrepresented, unless the variables are sufficiently
              correlated so that the total variation can be accounted for with
              just g-1 dimensions. The effect is most obvious when sample sizes
              are small relative to the number of variables, because smaller
              samples spread out less, but the distortion is present even for
              large samples. Strong covariance among variables largely reduces
              the magnitude of the problem, because it effectively reduces the
              dimensionality of the data and thus enables a larger proportion
              of the within-group variation to be accounted for within the
              g-1-dimensional space of a bgPCA. The distortion will still be
              relevant though its strength will vary from case to case
              depending on the structure of the data (p, g, covariances etc.).
              These are important problems for a method developed mainly to
              analyze variation among groups when there are very large numbers
              of variables and relatively small samples, a common situation in
              fields ranging from morphometrics (as in our examples) to
              molecular analyses.",

              circuits, the nature of these constraints and their consequences

              of a transcription network that controls the response to mating
              pheromone in yeast. A component of this network, the
              transcription regulator Ste12, has evolved two different modes of
              binding to a set of its target genes. In one group of species,
              Ste12 binds to specific DNA binding sites, while in another
              lineage it occupies DNA indirectly, relying on a second
              transcription regulator to recognize DNA. We show, through the
              construction of various possible evolutionary intermediates, that
              evolution of the direct mode of DNA binding was not directly
              accessible to the ancestor. Instead, it was contingent on a

              processes is a central goal of evolutionary biology. Direct
              insights into the extent and causes of evolutionary contingency
              have been limited to experimental systems, because it is
              difficult to know what happened in the deep past and to
              characterize other paths that evolution could have followed. Here
              we combine ancestral protein reconstruction, directed evolution
              and biophysical analysis to explore alternative 'might-have-been'
              trajectories during the ancient evolution of a novel protein
              function. We previously found that the evolution of cortisol
              specificity in the ancestral glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was
              contingent on permissive substitutions, which had no apparent
              effect on receptor function but were necessary for GR to tolerate
              the large-effect mutations that caused the shift in specificity.
              Here we show that alternative mutations that could have permitted
              the historical function-switching substitutions are extremely
              rare in the ensemble of genotypes accessible to the ancestral GR.
              In a library of thousands of variants of the ancestral protein,
              we recovered historical permissive substitutions but no
              alternative permissive genotypes. Using biophysical analysis, we
              found that permissive mutations must satisfy at least three
              physical requirements--they must stabilize specific local
              elements of the protein structure, maintain the correct energetic
              balance between functional conformations, and be compatible with
              the ancestral and derived structures--thus revealing why
              permissive mutations are rare. These findings demonstrate that GR
              evolution depended strongly on improbable, non-deterministic
              events, and this contingency arose from intrinsic biophysical
              properties of the protein.",

               many alternative trajectories that could have been taken but
               were not. A large-scale comparison of real and possible
               histories would establish whether the outcome of evolution
               represents an optimal state driven by natural selection or the
               contingent product of historical chance events; it would also
               reveal how the underlying distribution of functions across
               sequence space shaped historical evolution. Here we combine
               ancestral protein reconstruction with deep mutational scanning
               to characterize alternative histories in the sequence space
               around an ancient transcription factor, which evolved a novel
               biological function through well-characterized mechanisms. We
               find hundreds of alternative protein sequences that use diverse
               biochemical mechanisms to perform the derived function at least
               as well as the historical outcome. These alternatives all
               require prior permissive substitutions that do not enhance the
               derived function, but not all require the same permissive
               changes that occurred during history. We find that if evolution
               had begun from a different starting point within the network of
               sequences encoding the ancestral function, outcomes with
               different genetic and biochemical forms would probably have

               biological variation and ``race''---two phenomena that are not
               synonymous. Speaking to everyone without expert levels of
               familiarity with this material, we investigate whether the dog
               breed analogy for human race stands up to biology. It does not.
               Groups of humans that are culturally labeled as ``races'' differ
               in population structure, genotype--phenotype relationships, and
               phenotypic diversity from breeds of dogs in unsurprising ways,
               given how artificial selection has shaped the evolution of dogs,
               not humans. Our demonstration complements the vast body of
               existing knowledge about how human ``races'' differ in
               fundamental sociocultural, historical, and political ways from
               categories of nonhuman animals. By the end of this paper,
               readers will understand how the assumption that human races are
               the same as dog breeds is a racist strategy for justifying
               social, political, and economic inequality.",

              silent changes at an isolated ``molecular level,'' relevant to
              marking the steady pace of divergence, but not to the origin of
              biological structure, function, or complexity. Nevertheless,
              precisely these issues can be addressed in neutral models, such
              as those elaborated here with regard to scrambled ciliate genes,
              gRNA-mediated RNA editing, the transition from self-splicing to
              spliceosomal splicing, and the retention of duplicate genes. All
              of these are instances of a more general scheme of ``constructive
              neutral evolution'' that invokes biased variation, epistatic
              interactions, and excess capacities to account for a complex
              series of steps giving rise to novel structures or operations.
              The directional and constructive outcomes of these models are due
              not to neutral allele fixations per se, but to these other
              factors. Neutral models of this type may help to clarify the
              poorly understood role of nonselective factors in evolutionary

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Running economy (RE) is a determinant of performance
              in endurance sports and is a complex multi-factorial measure
              which reflects the combined functioning of bio-mechanical,
              neuro-muscular, metabolic and cardio-respiratory factors some of
              which are hereditary or adapt to coaching. Kenyan distance
              runners have dominated major global events with their unmatched
              performance for decades and this phenomenon has prompted several
              investigations aimed at establishing possible factors associated
              with their performance. This systematic review was aimed at
              establishing up-to date quantitative synthesis of evidence on
              biomechanical factors associated with running economy and
              performance of elite Kenyan distance runners and to provide an
              algorithm for future research and coaching strategies. METHODS: A
              comprehensive electronic search was conducted through June 2017.
              Quality appraisal was independently done by both reviewers using
              the STROBE checklist. Descriptive summaries and tables were used
              to illustrate biomechanical outcomes, mean differences and
              confidence intervals. Evidence from reviewed studies was graded
              according to the Australian National Health and Medical Research
              Council (NHMRC) hierarchy for aetiological factors and
              meta-analysis was performed where applicable. RESULTS: Eight
              cross-sectional studies were included. The overall methodological
              score was moderate (58\%). Elite Kenyan distance runners have
              significant longer gastroc-Achilles tendons compared to their
              counterparts while their shank length is not significantly
              longer. There is no certainty of evidence regarding the
              association between their characteristic unique profile of tall
              and slender bodies, low BMI and low body mass, short ground
              contact and flight times, greater forward lean torso and faster
              and greater forward leg swing with RE and performance.
              CONCLUSION: Our findings presents evidence on biomechanical
              factors associated with RE and performance of elite Kenyan
              distance runners. Despite these findings, there are a number of
              limitations inherent to this review including; low level of
              evidence, minimal number of included studies, small sample size

              (FLR) can play important roles for force production and movement
              economy during locomotion. This notion has become more relevant,
              and suggestion has been given that the Kenyan runners belonging
              to the world elite would have specific anatomical, mechanical,
              and functional properties in their lower limbs and that this
              feature could be responsible for their high running economy. The
              present study aimed to characterize the AT of elite Kenyan
              distance runners as compared with Japanese ones, and to examine
              the potential relationship with their running performance.
              Ultrasonography was used to measure AT cross-sectional area and
              AT soleus and gastrocnemius lengths. MA\_AT and FLR were
              calculated from the position of anatomical landmarks using
              sagittal plane photographs. MA\_AT was significantly longer and
              the FLR lower in Kenyans than in Japanese. Independently of the
              group, the running performance was positively related to the
              MA\_AT (r = 0.55, P < 0.001) and negatively to the FLR (r =
              -0.45, P = 0.002). These results suggest that longer MA\_AT and
              lower FLR could be advantageous in elite Kenyan runners, by
              contributing to effective endurance running performance in a
              protective and economical way.",

              maximal oxygen consumption (V̇O2max), fractional V̇O2max
              utilization and running economy. While Kenyan and Caucasian elite
              runners are able to reach very high, but similar maximal oxygen
              uptake levels, the V̇O2max of black South African elite runners
              seems to be slightly lower. Moreover, the studies of black and
              white South African runners indicate that the former are able to
              sustain the highest fraction of V̇O2max during long distance
              running. Results on adolescent Kenyan and Caucasian boys show
              that these boys are running at a similar percentage of V̇O2max
              during competition. Kenyan elite runners, however, appear to be
              able to run at a high \% of V̇O2max which must then have been
              achieved by training. A lower energy cost of running has been
              demonstrated in Kenyan elite runners and in untrained adolescent
              Kenyan boys compared to their Caucasian counterparts. In
              agreement with this are the results from studies on black South
              African elite runners who have shown similar low energy costs
              during running as the Kenyan elite runners. The good running
              economy cannot be explained by differences in muscle fibre type
              as they are the same in Kenyan and Caucasian runners. The same is
              true when comparing untrained adolescent Kenyan boys with their
              Caucasian counterparts. A difference exists in BMI and body
              shape, and the Kenyans long, slender legs could be advantageous
              when running as the energy cost when running is a function of leg
              mass. Studies comparing the response to training of Kenyans and
              Caucasians have shown similar trainability with respect to V̇O
              2max, running economy and oxidative enzymes. Taken all these data
              together it appears that running at a high fractional V̇O2max and
              having a good running economy may be the primary factors
              favouring the good performance of endurance athletes rather than
              them having a higher V̇O 2max than other elite runners. In
              addition to having the proper genes to shape their bodies and
              thereby contributing to a good running economy, the Kenyan elite
              runners have trained effectively and used their potential to be
              in the upper range both in regard to V̇O2max and to a high
              utilization of this capacity during endurance running.

              genotypes and sprint athlete status in elite Jamaican and US
              African American sprinters. METHODS: The ACTN3 R577X and the ACE

              (J-A; N = 116) and US sprinters (US-A; N = 114) were compared
              with controls from the Jamaican (J-C; N = 311) and US African
              American (US-C; N = 191) populations. Frequency differences
              between groups were assessed by exact test. RESULTS: For ACTN3,
              the XX genotype was found to be at very low frequency in both
              athlete and control cohorts (J-C = 2\%, J-A = 3\%, US-C = 4\%,
              US-A = 2\%). Athletes did not differ from controls in ACTN3
              genotype distribution (J, P = 0.87; US, P = 0.58). Similarly,
              neither US nor Jamaican athletes differed from controls in
              genotype at ACE I/D (J, P = 0.44; US, P = 0.37). Jamaican
              athletes did not differ from controls for A22982G genotype (P =
              0.28), although US sprinters did (P = 0.029), displaying an
              excess of heterozygotes relative to controls but no excess of GG
              homozygotes (US-C = 22\%, US-A = 18\%). CONCLUSIONS: Given that
              ACTN3 XX genotype is negatively associated with elite sprint
              athlete status, the underlying low frequency in these populations
              eliminates the possibility of replicating this association in
              Jamaican and US African American sprinters. The finding of no
              excess in ACE DD or GG genotypes in elite sprint athletes
              relative to controls suggests that ACE genotype is not a
              determinant of elite sprint athlete status. Copyright

              METHODS: Databases of PubMed and Web of Science were searched for
              studies reporting on genetic polymorphisms associated with the
              status of being a power athlete. Thirty-five articles published
              between 2008 and 2016 were identified as eligible including a
              total number of 5834 power athletes and 14,018 controls. A series
              of meta-analyses were conducted for each of the identified
              genetic polymorphisms associated with power athlete status. Odds
              ratios (ORs) based on the allele and genotype frequency with
              corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (95\%CI) were calculated
              per genetic variant. Heterogeneity of the studies was addressed
              by Chi-square based Q-statistics at 5\% significance level and a
              fixed or random effects model was used in absence or presence of
              heterogeneity respectively. Stratified analyses were conducted by
              race and sex to explore potential sources of heterogeneity.
              RESULTS: Significant associations were found for the genetic
              polymorphisms in the ACE (rs4363, rs1799752), ACTN3 (rs1815739),

              perspectives on elite athletic performance. In sports medicine,
              recent molecular biological advances in genomic studies have been
              over-interpreted, leading to a questionable
              `single-gene-as-magic-bullet' philosophy adopted by some
              practitioners. Similarly, although extensive involvement in
              training and practice is needed at elite levels, it has become
              apparent that the acquisition of expertise is not merely about
              amassing a requisite number of practice hours. Although an

              training responses may be theoretically associated with the most

              environments, this is a rare and complex outcome. The concept of

              type of exercise depends on the nature of the task, and is
              influenced by a variety of factors, including psychology,
              environment and genetic make up. Genetics provide useful
              insights, as sport performances can be ultimately defined as a
              polygenic trait. SOURCES OF DATA: We searched PubMed using the
              terms 'sports' and 'genetics' over the period 1990 to present.
              AREAS OF AGREEMENT: The physical performance phenotypes for which
              a genetic basis can be suspected include endurance capacity,
              muscle performance, physiological attitude to train and ability
              of tendons and ligaments to withstand injury. Genetic testing in
              sport would permit to identify individuals with optimal
              physiology and morphology, and also those with a greater capacity
              to respond/adapt to training and a lesser chance of suffering
              from injuries. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Ethical and practical
              caveats should be clearly emphasized. The translation of an
              advantageous genotype into a champion's phenotype is still
              influenced by environmental, psychological and sociological
              factors. EMERGING AREAS FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: The current
              scientific evidence on the relationship between genetics and
              sports look promising. There is a need for additional studies to
              determine whether genome-wide genotyping arrays would be really
              useful and cost-effective. Since exercise training regulates the
              expression of genes encoding various enzymes in muscle and other
              tissues, genetic research in sports will help clarify several
              aspects of human biology and physiology, such as RNA and protein

  abstract = "The ability of skeletal muscles to produce force at a high
              velocity, which is crucial for success in power and sprint
              performance, is strongly influenced by genetics and without the
              appropriate genetic make-up, an individual reduces his/her
              chances of becoming an exceptional power or sprinter athlete.
              Several genetic variants (i.e. polymorphisms) have been
              associated with elite power and sprint performance in the last
              few years and the current paradigm is that elite performance is a
              polygenic trait, with minor contributions of each variant to the
              unique athletic phenotype. The purpose of this review is to
              summarize the specific knowledge in the field of genetics and
              elite power performance, and to provide some future directions
              for research in this field. Of the polymorphisms associated with
              elite power and sprint performance, the $\alpha$-actinin-3 R577X
              polymorphism provides the most consistent results. ACTN3 is the
              only gene that shows a genotype and performance association
              across multiple cohorts of elite power athletes, and this
              association is strongly supported by mechanistic data from an
              Actn3 knockout mouse model. The angiotensin-1 converting enzyme
              insertion/deletion polymorphism (ACE I/D, registered single
              nucleotide polymorphism [rs]4646994), angiotensinogen (AGT
              Met235Thr rs699), skeletal adenosine monophosphate deaminase
              (AMPD1) Gln(Q)12Ter(X) [also termed C34T, rs17602729],
              interleukin-6 (IL-6 -174 G/C, rs1800795), endothelial nitric
              oxide synthase 3 (NOS3 -786 T/C, rs2070744; and Glu298Asp,
              rs1799983), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-$\alpha$
              (PPARA Intron 7 G/C, rs4253778), and mitochondrial uncoupling
              protein 2 (UCP2 Ala55Val, rs660339) polymorphisms have also been
              associated with elite power performance, but the findings are
              less consistent. In general, research into the genetics of
              athletic performance is limited by a small sample size in
              individual studies and the heterogeneity of study samples, often
              including athletes from multiple-difference sporting disciplines.
              In the future, large, homogeneous, strictly defined elite power
              athlete cohorts need to be established though multinational
              collaboration, so that meaningful genome-wide association studies
              can be performed. Such an approach would provide unbiased
              identification of potential genes that influence elite athletic

  abstract = "Since the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, Kenyan and Ethiopian runners
              have dominated the middle- and long-distance events in athletics
              and have exhibited comparable dominance in international
              cross-country and road-racing competition. Several factors have
              been proposed to explain the extraordinary success of the Kenyan
              and Ethiopian distance runners, including (1) genetic
              predisposition, (2) development of a high maximal oxygen uptake
              as a result of extensive walking and running at an early age, (3)
              relatively high hemoglobin and hematocrit, (4) development of
              good metabolic ``economy/efficiency'' based on somatotype and
              lower limb characteristics, (5) favorable skeletal-muscle-fiber
              composition and oxidative enzyme profile, (6) traditional
              Kenyan/Ethiopian diet, (7) living and training at altitude, and
              (8) motivation to achieve economic success. Some of these factors
              have been examined objectively in the laboratory and field,
              whereas others have been evaluated from an observational
              perspective. The purpose of this article is to present the

              the unprecedented success of Kenyan and Ethiopian distance
              runners, including recent studies that examined potential links

              the result of favorable somatotypical characteristics lending to
              exceptional biomechanical and metabolic economy/efficiency;
              chronic exposure to altitude in combination with moderate-volume,

              performance. AIM: To examine the association between these
              variants and sprint time in elite athletes. METHODS: We collected
              a total of 555 best personal 100-, 200-, and 400-m times of 346
              elite sprinters in a large cohort of elite Caucasian or African
              origin sprinters from 10 different countries. Sprinters were
              genotyped for ACTN3 R577X and ACE ID variants. RESULTS: On
              average, male Caucasian sprinters with the ACTN3 577RR or the ACE
              DD genotype had faster best 200-m sprint time than their 577XX
              (21.19 $\pm$ 0.53 s vs. 21.86 $\pm$ 0.54 s, p = 0.016) and ACE II
              (21.33 $\pm$ 0.56 vs. 21.93 $\pm$ 0.67 sec, p = 0.004)
              counterparts and only one case of ACE II, and no cases of ACTN3
              577XX, had a faster 200-m time than the 2012 London Olympics
              qualifying (vs. 12 qualified sprinters with 577RR or 577RX
              genotype). Caucasian sprinters with the ACE DD genotype had
              faster best 400-m sprint time than their ACE II counterparts
              (46.94 $\pm$ 1.19 s vs. 48.50 $\pm$ 1.07 s, p = 0.003). Using
              genetic models we found that the ACTN3 577R allele and ACE D
              allele dominant model account for 0.92 \% and 1.48 \% of sprint
              time variance, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite sprint
              performance relying on many gene variants and environment, the \%
              sprint time variance explained by ACE and ACTN3 is substantial at
              the elite level and might be the difference between a world

               running remains largely unexplained; proposed reasons include

               Ethiopian athletes with the general Ethiopian population and
               assess the validity of reports linking running long distances to
               school with endurance success. METHODS: Questionnaires,
               administered to 114 members (male and female) of the Ethiopian
               national athletics team and 111 Ethiopian control subjects (C)
               obtained information on place of birth, language, distance and
               method of travel to school. Athletes were separated into three
               groups according to athletic discipline: marathon (M; N = 34);
               5,000-10,000 m (5-10 km; N = 42); and other track and field
               athletes (TF; N = 38). Frequency differences between groups were
               assessed using contingency chi-square tests. RESULTS: Regional
               distributions of marathon athletes differed from controls (P <
               0.001) and track and field athletes (P = 0.013), but not the 5-
               to 10-km athletes (P = 0.21). The 5- to 10-km athletes also
               differed from controls (P < 0.001). Marathon athletes exhibited
               excess from the regions of Arsi and Shewa (M: 73\%; 5-10 km:
               43\%; TF: 29\%; C: 15\%). The language distribution of marathon
               athletes differed from all groups (P < 0.001), with a
               predominance of languages of Cushitic origin (M: 75\%, 5-10 km:
               52\%, TF: 46\%, C: 30\%). A higher proportion of marathon

              proteins related to dystrophin. The two skeletal muscle isoforms
              of alpha-actinin (ACTN2 and ACTN3) are major structural
              components of the Z-line involved in anchoring the
              actin-containing thin filaments. In humans, ACTN2 is expressed in
              all muscle fibres, while ACTN3 expression is restricted to a
              subset of type 2 fibres. We have recently demonstrated that
              alpha-actinin-3 is absent in approximately 18\% of individuals in
              a range of human populations, and that homozygosity for a
              premature stop codon (577X) accounts for most cases of true
              alpha-actinin-3 deficiency. Absence of alpha-actinin-3 is not
              associated with an obvious disease phenotype, raising the
              possibility that ACTN3 is functionally redundant in humans, and
              that alpha-actinin-2 is able to compensate for alpha-actinin-3
              deficiency. We now present data concerning the expression of
              ACTN3 in other species. Genotyping of non-human primates
              indicates that the 577X null mutation has likely arisen in
              humans. The mouse genome contains four orthologues which all map
              to evolutionarily conserved syntenic regions for the four human
              genes. Murine Actn2 and Actn3 are differentially expressed,
              spatially and temporally, during embryonic development and, in
              contrast to humans, alpha-actinin-2 expression does not
              completely overlap alpha-actinin-3 in postnatal skeletal muscle,
              suggesting independent function. Furthermore, sequence comparison
              of human, mouse and chicken alpha-actinin genes demonstrates that
              ACTN3 has been conserved over a long period of evolutionary time,
              implying a constraint on evolutionary rate imposed by continued
              function of the gene. These observations provide a real framework
              in which to test theoretical models of genetic redundancy as they
              apply to human populations. In addition we highlight the need for
              caution in making conclusions about gene function from the

              the success of elite East African endurance runners and West
              African sprinters. METHODS: The R577X polymorphism was genotyped
              in 198 Ethiopian controls and 76 elite Ethiopian endurance
              athletes, 158 Kenyan controls and 284 elite Kenyan endurance
              runners, and 60 Nigerian controls and 62 elite Nigerian power
              athletes. Statistical analyses were performed by exact tests of
              population differentiation, using Arlequin, version 3. Analyses
              were carried out using 1 x 10(6) Markov chain steps, and 1 x
              10(5) dememorization steps. RESULTS: The frequency of the X
              allele was extremely low among Kenyans and Nigerians
              (approximately 1\% homozygosity) and higher in Ethiopians
              (approximately 11\% homozygosity). The low baseline frequencies
              of the three populations tested mean that any associations with
              sprint performance would likely be obscured. In Ethiopians, where
              baseline levels of 577XX were about 11\%, there was no increased
              frequency in the endurance athletes. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest
              that alpha-actinin-3 deficiency is not a major influence on
              performance in African athletes.",

              our understanding of the training process leading to a
              world-class sprint performance is limited. The objective of this
              review is to integrate scientific and best practice literature
              regarding the training and development of elite sprint
              performance. Sprint performance is heavily dependent upon genetic
              traits, and the annual within-athlete performance differences are
              lower than the typical variation, the smallest worthwhile change,
              and the influence of external conditions such as wind, monitoring
              methodologies, etc. Still, key underlying determinants (e.g.,
              power, technique, and sprint-specific endurance) are trainable.
              In this review, we describe how well-known training principles
              (progression, specificity, variation/periodization, and
              individualization) and varying training methods (e.g.,
              sprinting/running, technical training, strength/power, plyometric
              training) are used in a sprint training context. Indeed, there is
              a considerable gap between science and best practice in how
              training principles and methods are applied. While the vast
              majority of sprint-related studies are performed on young team
              sport athletes and focus on brief sprints with maximal intensity
              and short recoveries, elite sprinters perform sprinting/running
              over a broad range of distances and with varying intensity and
              recovery periods. Within best practice, there is a stronger link
              between choice of training component (i.e., modality, duration,
              intensity, recovery, session rate) and the intended purpose of
              the training session compared with the ``one-size-fits-all''
              approach in scientific literature. This review provides a point
              of departure for scientists and practitioners regarding the
              training and development of elite sprint performance and can
              serve as a position statement for outlining state-of-the-art
              sprint training recommendations and for generation of new

              sports performance traits, and over 20 polymorphisms may
              condition the status of the elite athlete. However, with the

              how to use genotyping as a tool for predicting exercise/sports

              the study results difficult to interpret. Additionally, many

              the genotypes associated with elite marathon athlete status
              and/or marathon running performance. The search identified 241

              existing literature with mostly clear delineations in oxygen
              uptake across a range of speeds in moderately and highly trained
              and elite runners. Despite being simple to measure and acceptably

  abstract  = "Individuals of admixed ancestries (for example, African
               Americans) inherit a mosaic of ancestry segments (local
               ancestry) originating from multiple continental ancestral
               populations. This offers the unique opportunity of investigating
               the similarity of genetic effects on traits across ancestries
               within the same population. Here we introduce an approach to
               estimate correlation of causal genetic effects (radmix) across
               local ancestries and analyze 38 complex traits in
               African-European admixed individuals (N = 53,001) to observe
               very high correlations (meta-analysis radmix = 0.95, 95\%
               credible interval 0.93--0.97), much higher than correlation of
               causal effects across continental ancestries. We replicate our
               results using regression-based methods from marginal genome-wide
               association study summary statistics. We also report realistic
               scenarios where regression-based methods yield inflated
               heterogeneity-by-ancestry due to ancestry-specific tagging of
               causal effects, and/or polygenicity. Our results motivate
               genetic analyses that assume minimal heterogeneity in causal
               effects by ancestry, with implications for the inclusion of
               ancestry-diverse individuals in studies. This analysis of
               individuals of admixed genetic ancestries suggests that complex
               trait causal variant effect sizes are, by and large, similar
               across ancestries, and discusses the implications for the study

              20 years after its publication. Here, we highlight four factors

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Attempts at predicting individual risk of disease
              based on common germline genetic variation have largely been
              disappointing. The present paper formalises why genetic
              prediction at the individual level is and will continue to have
              limited utility given the aetiological architecture of most
              common complex diseases. METHODS: Data were simulated on one
              million populations with 10 000 individuals in each populations
              with varying prevalences of a genetic risk factor, an interacting
              environmental factor and the background rate of disease. The
              determinant risk ratio and risk difference magnitude for the
              association between a gene variant and disease is a function of
              the prevalence of the interacting factors that activate the gene,
              and the background rate of disease. RESULTS: The risk ratio and
              total excess cases due to the genetic factor increase as the
              prevalence of interacting factors increase, and decrease as the
              background rate of disease increases. Germline genetic variations
              have high predictive capacity for individual disease only under
              conditions of high heritability of particular genetic sequences,
              plausible only under rare variant hypotheses. CONCLUSIONS: Under
              a model of common germline genetic variants that interact with
              other genes and/or environmental factors in order to cause
              disease, the predictive capacity of common genetic variants is
              determined by the prevalence of the factors that interact with
              the variant and the background rate. A focus on estimating
              genetic associations for the purpose of prediction without
              explicitly grounding such work in an understanding of modifiable
              (including environmentally influenced) factors will be limited in

               The biology curriculum appears to be a crucial locus of
               intervention for either reinforcing or undermining students'
               racial essentialist views. The Mendelian genetic models
               dominating textbooks, particularly in combination with racially
               inflected language sometimes used when teaching about monogenic
               disorders, can increase middle and high school students' racial
               essentialism and opposition to policies to increase equity.
               These findings are of particular concern given the increasing
               spread of racist misinformation online and the misappropriation
               of human genomics research by white supremacists, who take
               advantage of low levels of genetics literacy in the general
               public. Encouragingly, however, teaching updated information
               about the geographical distribution of human genetic variation
               and the complex, multifactorial basis of most human traits,
               reduces students' endorsement of racial essentialism. The
               genetics curriculum is therefore a key tool in combating
               misinformation and scientific racism. Here, we describe a
               framework and example teaching materials for teaching students
               key concepts in genetics, human evolutionary history, and human
               phenotypic variation at the undergraduate level. This framework
               can be flexibly applied in biology and anthropology classes and

               undergraduate-level instructors with varying levels of expertise

               genetics to combat scientific racism, including an evolving set

               insisted on coyness and monogamous tendencies, evidence from the
               field of primatology started challenging those assumptions in
               the 1970s. Decades later, there exists many competing and
               overlapping hypotheses stressing the potential fitness benefits
               of female short-term and extra-pair mating. Female mammals are
               now seen as enacting varied and flexible reproductive
               strategies. This is both a victory for science, with a better
               fit between theory and reality, and for feminism, with the
               downfall of narrow stereotypes about female sexuality. However,
               evolutionary hypotheses on female mating strategies are
               routinely invoked among the antifeminist online communities

               two studies (N = 192, N = 258) women indicated how much hair
               they would recommend hypothetical clients have cut off in their

               hair, and how much hair they wished to have cut off.
               Participants also provided self-report measures of their own
               mate value and intrasexual competitiveness. In both studies,
               participants' intrasexual competitiveness positively predicted

               wanting as little as possible cut off -- circumstances wherein
               cutting off too much hair is most likely to indicate sabotage.
               Considering data across both collectively, women tended to
               recommend cutting the most hair off clients they perceived to be

              interaction were studied with eleven internationally high-level

              METHODS: Ultrasonography and kinematics were applied together
              with surface electromyography (EMG) recordings of leg muscles
              when subjects ran on treadmill at 9.0 (SLOW) and 13.9 km h-1
              (MEDIUM). RESULTS: At each speed, both groups presented similar
              contact and flight times. The kinematic and ultrasound analyses
              revealed that, in contrast to the Japanese runners, the Kenyans
              demonstrated during contact smaller stretching and shortening
              amplitudes (p < 0.01) of the tendinous tissue of medial
              gastrocnemius (MG), but greater tendon contribution to the
              muscle-tendon unit shortening (p < 0.05). The MG fascicles of the
              Kenyans were shorter not only at the resting standing position,
              but also during the contact phase at both running speeds (p <
              0.01). The EMG profiles of the Kenyans showed lower
              braking/preactivation ratio in both MG and tibialis anterior (p <
              0.05) muscles. They were also characterized by negative
              relationships between the Achilles tendon moment arm and the MG
              fascicle shortening during contact (r = -0.54, p < 0.01). In

              cycle muscle activation profile of relatively high MG EMG
              activity during the braking phase. CONCLUSION: These findings
              provide new suggestions that the Kenyans have unique structural
              characteristics which can result in the reduction of muscle and
              tendinous stretch-shortening loading together with smaller muscle
              activation during contact at submaximal running speed.",

              vastus lateralis (v.l.) and the gastrocnemius muscles. Muscle
              fiber size and composition were similar in the various groups
              (4.6-5.1 X 10(3) microns2; ST approximately 60-70\%; FTa 30-40\%;
              FTb < 6.0\%) with a tendency for some more (approximately 5\%)
              FTa fibers in the gastrocnemius muscle. Mean number of

              (mean age 16.6 years) from a town (n = 11) and from a rural area
              (n = 19) in western Kenya (altitude ∼2000 m.a.s.l.) in regard to
              their body dimensions, oxygen uptake and physical activity level.
              The town boys had a mean maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2max ) of 50
              (range: 45-60) mL kg -1 min -1 , whereas the village boys reached
              a value of 55 (37-63) mL kg -1 min -1 (p < 0.01) in VO 2max . The
              running economy, determined as the oxygen cost at a given running
              speed, was 221 mL kg -1 km -1 (597 mL kg -0.75 km -1 ) for town
              as well as for village boys. The body mass index (BMI) was very
              low for town as well as for village boys (18.6 vs 18.4 kg m -2 ).
              The daily mean time spent working in the field during secondary
              school and doing sports were significantly higher in village boys

              and village boys corresponds well with findings in Kenyan elite
              runners. They are very slender with relatively long legs. In
              addition, the VO 2max of the village boys was higher than that of
              the town boys, which is probably due to a higher physical
              activity level of the village boys during secondary school.",

  abstract = "IQ heritability, the portion of a population's IQ variability
              attributable to the effects of genes1, has been investigated for
              nearly a century, yet it remains controversial. Covariance
              between relatives may be due not only to genes, but also to
              shared environments, and most previous models have assumed
              different degrees of similarity induced by environments specific
              to twins, to non-twin siblings (henceforth siblings), and to
              parents and off- spring. We now evaluate an alternative model
              that replaces these three environments by two maternal womb
              environments, one for twins and another for siblings, along with
              a common home environment. Meta-analysis of 212 previous studies
              shows that our `maternal-effects' model fits the data better than
              the `family- environments' model. Maternal effects, often assumed
              to be negligible, account for 20\% of covariance between twins
              and 5\% between siblings, and the effects of genes are
              correspondingly reduced, with two measures of heritability being
              less than 50\%. The shared maternal environment may explain the
              striking correlation between the IQs of twins, especially those
              of adult twins that were reared apart. IQ heritability increases
              during early childhood, but whether it stabilizes thereafter
              remains unclear. A recent study of octogenarians2, for instance,
              suggests that IQ heritability either remains constant through
              adolescence and adulthood3, or continues to increase with age2.
              Although the latter hypothesis has recently been endorsed4, it
              gathers only modest statistical support in our analysis when
              compared to the maternal-effects hypothesis. Our analysis
              suggests that it will be important to understand the basis for
              these maternal effects if ways in which IQ might be increased are
              to be identified.",

              variation, often in easily visualized two-dimensional maps. Many
              recent studies have reported similarity between geographic maps
              of population locations and MDS or PCA maps of genetic variation
              inferred from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However,
              this similarity has been evident primarily in a qualitative
              sense; and, because different multivariate techniques and marker
              sets have been used in different studies, it has not been
              possible to formally compare genetic variation datasets in terms
              of their levels of similarity with geography. In this study,
              using genome-wide SNP data from 128 populations worldwide, we
              perform a systematic analysis to quantitatively evaluate the
              similarity of genes and geography in different geographic
              regions. For each of a series of regions, we apply a Procrustes
              analysis approach to find an optimal transformation that
              maximizes the similarity between PCA maps of genetic variation
              and geographic maps of population locations. We consider examples
              in Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, East Asia, and Central/South
              Asia, as well as in a worldwide sample, finding that significant
              similarity between genes and geography exists in general at
              different geographic levels. The similarity is highest in our
              examples for Asia and, once highly distinctive populations have
              been removed, Sub-Saharan Africa. Our results provide a
              quantitative assessment of the geographic structure of human
              genetic variation worldwide, supporting the view that geography

              answer to a longstanding question: why do Jews of Ashkenazi
              ancestry carry so many recessive genes for harmful conditions? It
              argues that in heterozygotes, these alleles substantially
              increase intelligence. For 800 years, Ashkenazi were confined to
              professions demanding high cognitive skills. Those with the
              alleles prospered, and had more surviving children, thus
              selecting for the alleles in the population. This thesis has
              received widespread media and web attention, and represents a
              growing tendency to explain psychological differences between
              populations as due to different genes. This article challenges
              NHAl, showing so many points of improbability, that the entire
              hypothesis is highly unlikely. The main criticisms are: (a)
              Contrary to NHAI's argument that the inherited conditions are due
              to selection, population bottlenecks and drift remain strong
              explanations of their frequency, and consistent with historical
              information. (b) In NHAl, less than half of all inherited
              conditions have even a suggested pathway to higher intelligence.
              (c) The inference that genes which stimulate aspects of neural
              growth are linked to higher intelligence is pure speculation
              predicated on a simplistic view of neurological development. (d)
              The claimed connection between three specific conditions and
              higher IQ has virtually no empirical support whatever. (e) The
              demonstrated IQ advantage of Ashkenazi Jews as a whole is less
              than asserted. (f) The multi-point IQ boosts proposed for
              specific genes are very inconsistent with current research on the
              genetics ofIQ. (g) Even within the mainstream ofIQ research,
              which emphasizes geneticlbiological bases, the extent of
              Ashkenazi IQ advantage is easily accommodated as due to
              enviromnent. (h) The ``Talmudic Tradition'' of emphasizing
              learning and abstract reasoning provides a clear cultural
              explanation for higher IQ among Ashkenazi. In Ashkenazi history,
              NHAI's assumption that higher intelligence led to greater income
              is contradicted by (1) a rigid system of social stratification,
              G) the critical importance for amassing wealth of capital, social
              connections, and political patrons, and (k) the absence of any
              evidence that success in business required anything more than
              average intelligence.",

              maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) of 47 (44-51) ml.kg-1.min-1,
              whereas similarly aged boys regularly walking or running but not
              training for competition reached above 62 (58-71) ml.kg-1.min-1
              in VO2max. Kenyan runners in active training had 68 +/- 1.4

              Scandinavian runners were not significantly different from the

              none of the Scandinavians reached as high individual values as

              international runners, tracking their evolution over the period
              of their international emergence and current
              dominance.\textbackslashn\textbackslashnMETHODS:The authors
              analyzed male track distance events from 800m upwards from all
              the major global athletics championships from 1964 to 2013, and
              the annual Top-25 world marathon performances since
              1990.\textbackslashn\textbackslashnRESULTS:The percentage of
              top-25 marathon performances and medals won by Kenyan and
              Kalenjin runners have increased over time with Nandi subtribe
              outperforming the rest of the world outside Africa (r > .70,
              large effect). However, Europe, North America, Oceania, Asia, and
              South America decreased over time in top marathon performances
              and track medals won (r > .70, large effect). The tribe and
              subtribe distribution was different in the marathon than in the
              track: Maasais were more likely to feature in medals won in
              shorter track events than in the top 25 of the world marathon
              rankings (risk ratio [RR] = 9.67, very large effect). This was
              also the case for Marakwets (RR = 6.44, very large effect) and
              Pokots (RR = 4.83, large effect). On the other hand, Keiyos,
              Kikuyus, Kipsigis, Sabaots, and Tugens were more likely to
              succeed in the marathon than in shorter track events (RR > 2.0,
              moderate effect).\textbackslashn\textbackslashnCONCLUSION:These
              data emphasize that the previously documented emergence of
              African distance runners is primarily a Kenyan phenomenon, driven
              by the Kalenjin tribe and in particular the Nandi subtribe. This
              supports the complex interaction between genotype, phenotype, and

  abstract = "The pioneering model of Henri, Michaelis, and Menten was based on
              the fast equilibrium assumption: the substrate binds its enzyme
              reversibly, and substrate dissociation is much faster than
              product formation. Here, we examine this assumption from a
              somewhat different point of view, asking what fraction of
              enzyme-substrate complexes are futile, i.e., result in
              dissociation rather than product formation. In Knowles' notion of
              a ``perfect'' enzyme, all encounters of the enzyme with its
              substrate result in conversion to product. Thus, the perfect
              enzyme's catalytic efficiency, kcat/KM, is constrained by only
              the diffusion on-rate, and the fraction of futile encounters
              (defined as $\varphi$) approaches zero. The available data on
              >1000 different enzymes suggest that for $\geq$90\% of enzymes
              $\varphi$ > 0.99 and for the ``average enzyme'' $\varphi$ $\geq$
              0.9999; namely, <1 of 10(4) encounters is productive. Thus, the
              ``fast equilibrium'' assumption holds for the vast majority of
              enzymes. We discuss possible molecular origins for the dominance
              of futile encounters, including the coexistence of multiple
              sub-states of an enzyme's active site (enzyme floppiness) and/or
              its substrate. Floppiness relates to the inherent flexibility of
              proteins, but also to conflicting demands, or trade-offs, between
              rate acceleration (the rate-determining chemical step) and
              catalytic turnover, or between turnover rate and accuracy. The
              study of futile encounters and active-site floppiness may
              contribute to a better understanding of enzyme catalysis, enzyme
              evolution, and improved enzyme design.",

              Yet, all of the discussion on heredity has been based on non-DNA
              evidence. It is largely neglected that DNA and environmental data
              at individual level are indispensable for understanding the
              development of cognitive ability. In this article, we report
              findings from a study that uses both ability-related polygenic
              scores (PGSs) and a rich set of socioeconomic measures from Add
              Health. In an all-ethnicity sample excluding blacks, a
              social-science model predicts verbal ability well yielding an R2
              of 17.5\%. Adding two ability-related PGSs increases this R2 by
              1.7\%. Such models yield more accurate estimates of the effects
              of the PGSs and those of SES context, and provide an estimated
              degree to which SES context is influenced by parental genomes.
              Schooling and neighborhood remain important to verbal ability
              even after an early measure of verbal ability is adjusted in the
              model. Although the influence from the genome is evident, the

               proposed models of population history to data when analyzing
               full genome sequencing data---that is, all single nucleotide
               polymorphisms (SNPs) in the individuals being analyzed---but
               they are also guaranteed to allow robust tests of models for
               SNPs ascertained as polymorphic in a population that is an
               outgroup in a phylogenetic sense to all groups being analyzed.
               True ``outgroup ascertainment'' is in practice impossible in
               humans because our species has arisen from a substructured
               ancestral population that does not descend from a homogeneous
               ancestral population going back many hundreds of thousands of
               years into the past. However, initial studies suggested that
               non-outgroup-ascertainment schemes might produce robust enough
               results using f-statistics, and that motivated widespread
               fitting of models to data using non-outgroup-ascertained SNP
               panels such as the ``Affymetrix Human Origins array'' which has
               been genotyped on thousands of modern individuals from hundreds
               of populations, or the ``1240k'' in-solution enrichment reagent
               which has been the source of about 70\% of published genome-wide
               data for ancient humans. In this study, we show that while
               analyses of population history using such panels work well for
               studies of relationships among non-African populations and one
               African outgroup, when co-modeling more than one sub-Saharan
               African and/or archaic human groups (Neanderthals and
               Denisovans), fitting of f-statistics to such SNP sets is
               expected to frequently lead to false rejection of true
               demographic histories, and failure to reject incorrect models.
               Analyzing panels of SNPs polymorphic in archaic humans, which
               has been suggested as a solution for the ascertainment problem,
               has limited statistical power and retains important biases.
               However, by carrying out simulations of diverse demographic
               histories, we show that bias in inferences based on f-statistics
               can be minimized by ascertaining on variants common in a union
               of diverse African groups; such ascertainment retains high

               all primates was solitary and that other forms of social
               organization evolved later, with transitions being driven by
               various life history traits and ecological factors. However,
               recent research showed that many understudied primate species
               previously assumed to be solitary actually live in pairs, and
               intraspecific variation in social organization is common. We
               built a detailed database from primary field studies quantifying
               the number of social units expressing different social
               organizations in each population. We used Bayesian phylogenetic
               models to infer the probability of each social organization,
               conditional on several socioecological and life history
               predictors. Here, we show that when intraspecific variation is
               accounted for, the ancestral social organization of primates was
               inferred to be variable, with the most common social
               organization being pair-living but with approximately 10 to 20\%
               of social units of the ancestral population deviating from this
               pattern by being solitary living. Body size and activity
               patterns had large effects on transitions between types of
               social organizations. As in other mammalian clades, pair-living
               is closely linked to small body size and likely more common in
               ancestral species. Our results challenge the assumption that
               ancestral primates were solitary and that pair-living evolved
               afterward emphasizing the importance of focusing on field data

               maintenance of individual differences in behavior and physiology
               is a fundamental goal in ecology and evolution. The pace‐of‐life
               syndrome hypothesis is often invoked to explain the maintenance
               of such within‐population variation. This hypothesis predicts
               that behavioral traits are part of a suite of correlated traits
               that collectively determine an individual's propensity to
               prioritize reproduction or survival. A key assumption of this
               hypothesis is that these traits are underpinned by genetic
               trade‐offs among life‐history traits: genetic variants that
               increase fertility, reproduction and growth might also reduce
               lifespan. We performed a systematic literature review and
               meta‐analysis to summarize the evidence for the existence of
               genetic trade‐offs between five key life‐history traits:
               survival, growth rate, body size, maturation rate, and
               fertility. Counter to our predictions, we found an overall
               positive genetic correlation between survival and other
               life‐history traits and no evidence for any genetic correlations
               between the non‐survival life‐history traits. This finding was

              a way of preventing regret experienced by some people who
              reidentify with the gender they were assigned at birth after
              medically transitioning. This article reviews the theoretical and

              assessing trans patients' gender identity and/or dysphoria as a
              condition of eligibility for gender-affirming interventions. We
              find that the DSM-5 diagnosis, taking gender history,

              stereotyping, arbitrary, and unproven considerations and, as a

              assumed to be more functional or adaptive than their simpler
              alternatives. However, in 1999, Arlin Stolzfus published a paper

              England and the United States during the past 40 years. It is
              based on faith in the power of natural selection as an optimizing
              agent. It proceeds by breaking an oragnism into unitary 'traits'
              and proposing an adaptive story for each considered separately.
              Trade-offs among competing selective demands exert the only brake
              upon perfection; non-optimality is thereby rendered as a result
              of adaptation as well. We criticize this approach and attempt to
              reassert a competing notion (long popular in continental Europe)
              that organisms must be analysed as integrated wholes, with
              Baupl{\"a}ne so constrained by phyletic heritage, pathways of
              development and general architecture that the constraints
              themselves become more interesting and more important in

              mediate change when it occurs. We fault the adaptationist
              programme for its failure to distinguish current utility from
              reasons for origin (male tyrannosaurs may have used their
              diminutive front legs to titillate female partners, but this will
              not explain why they got so small); for its unwillingness to
              consider alternatives to adaptive stories; for its reliance upon
              plausibility alone as a criterion for accepting speculative
              tales; and for its failure to consider adequately such competing
              themes as random fixation of alleles, production of non-adaptive
              structures by developmental correlation with selected features

              debate for more than a century. According to Fisher's principle,
              offspring sex ratio remains approximately equal through a process
              of negative frequency-dependent balancing selection. That is,
              individuals whose alleles predispose them to produce the rarer
              sex will have greater fitness, causing these alleles to increase
              in frequency until the population sex ratio is even again and the
              allele is no longer advantageous. Recently, though, analysis of
              all Swedish births since 1932 revealed that offspring sex ratio
              is not heritable, demonstrating that Fisher's principle cannot
              operate in humans. Some have argued that Fisher's principle makes
              no prediction about the heritability of offspring sex ratio at
              equilibrium and therefore can still serve as a valid explanatory
              framework. We used agent-based modelling to simulate the
              operation of Fisher's principle and its effects on genetic
              variation in offspring sex ratio over 5000 generations. Our
              simulations demonstrate that the operation of Fisher's principle
              at equilibrium does not actively eliminate heritability, contrary
              to implicit assumptions in previous arguments. These results,
              combined with recent evidence that offspring sex ratio is not
              heritable in humans, suggest that Fisher's principle is not a

  abstract = "A goal of biology is to predict how mutations combine to alter
              phenotypes, fitness and disease. It is often assumed that
              mutations combine additively or with interactions that can be
              predicted. Here, we show using simulations that, even for the
              simple example of the lambda phage transcription factor CI
              repressing a gene, this assumption is incorrect and that perfect
              measurements of the effects of mutations on a trait and
              mechanistic understanding can be insufficient to predict what
              happens when two mutations are combined. This apparent paradox
              arises because mutations can have different biophysical effects
              to cause the same change in a phenotype and the outcome in a
              double mutant depends upon what these hidden biophysical changes
              actually are. Pleiotropy and non-monotonic functions further
              confound prediction of how mutations interact. Accurate
              prediction of phenotypes and disease will sometimes not be
              possible unless these biophysical ambiguities can be resolved
              using additional measurements.",

               about individual sampling locations, a clustering algorithm
               applied to multilocus genotypes from worldwide human populations
               produced genetic clusters largely coincident with major
               geographic regions. It has been argued, however, that the degree
               of clustering is diminished by use of samples with greater
               uniformity in geographic distribution, and that the clusters we
               identified were a consequence of uneven sampling along genetic
               clines. Expanding our earlier dataset from 377 to 993 markers,
               we systematically examine the influence of several study design
               variables--sample size, number of loci, number of clusters,
               assumptions about correlations in allele frequencies across
               populations, and the geographic dispersion of the sample--on the
               ``clusteredness'' of individuals. With all other variables held
               constant, geographic dispersion is seen to have comparatively
               little effect on the degree of clustering. Examination of the
               relationship between genetic and geographic distance supports a
               view in which the clusters arise not as an artifact of the
               sampling scheme, but from small discontinuous jumps in genetic
               distance for most population pairs on opposite sides of
               geographic barriers, in comparison with genetic distance for
               pairs on the same side. Thus, analysis of the 993-locus dataset
               corroborates our earlier results: if enough markers are used
               with a sufficiently large worldwide sample, individuals can be
               partitioned into genetic clusters that match major geographic
               subdivisions of the globe, with some individuals from
               intermediate geographic locations having mixed membership in the

  abstract  = "Historical processes display some degree of ``contingency,''
               meaning their outcomes are sensitive to seemingly
               inconsequential events that can fundamentally change the future.
               Contingency is what makes historical outcomes unpredictable.
               Unlike many other natural phenomena, evolution is a historical
               process. Evolutionary change is often driven by the
               deterministic force of natural selection, but natural selection
               works upon variation that arises unpredictably through time by
               random mutation, and even beneficial mutations can be lost by
               chance through genetic drift. Moreover, evolution has taken
               place within a planetary environment with a particular history
               of its own. This tension between determinism and contingency
               makes evolutionary biology a kind of hybrid between science and
               history. While philosophers of science examine the nuances of
               contingency, biologists have performed many empirical studies of
               evolutionary repeatability and contingency. Here, we review the
               experimental and comparative evidence from these studies.
               Replicate populations in evolutionary ``replay'' experiments
               often show parallel changes, especially in overall performance,
               although idiosyncratic outcomes show that the particulars of a
               lineage's history can affect which of several evolutionary paths
               is taken. Comparative biologists have found many notable
               examples of convergent adaptation to similar conditions, but
               quantification of how frequently such convergence occurs is
               difficult. On balance, the evidence indicates that evolution
               tends to be surprisingly repeatable among closely related
               lineages, but disparate outcomes become more likely as the
               footprint of history grows deeper. Ongoing research on the
               structure of adaptive landscapes is providing additional insight
               into the interplay of fate and chance in the evolutionary
               process.",

              global trends are rarely addressed. We performed an analysis of
              k(cat) and K(M) values of several thousand enzymes collected from
              the literature. We found that the ``average enzyme'' exhibits a

              below the diffusion limit and the characteristic textbook
              portrayal of kinetically superior enzymes. Why do most enzymes
              exhibit moderate catalytic efficiencies? Maximal rates may not
              evolve in cases where weaker selection pressures are expected. We
              find, for example, that enzymes operating in secondary metabolism
              are, on average, ~30-fold slower than those of central
              metabolism. We also find indications that the physicochemical
              properties of substrates affect the kinetic parameters.
              Specifically, low molecular mass and hydrophobicity appear to
              limit K(M) optimization. In accordance, substitution with
              phosphate, CoA, or other large modifiers considerably lowers the
              K(M) values of enzymes utilizing the substituted substrates. It
              therefore appears that both evolutionary selection pressures and

              in order to argue the fit of the model to the data suggests that:
              (1) variation in socioeconomic status is largely determined by
              additive genetic variation; (2) contemporary English people
              ``remain correlated in outcomes with their lineage relatives in
              exactly the same way as in preindustrial England''; and (3)
              social mobility has remained static over this time period due to
              strong assortative mating on a ``social genotype.'' These
              conclusions are based on a misconstrual of model parameters,
              which conflates genetic and non-genetic transmission (e.g. of
              wealth) within families. As we show, there is strong confounding
              of genetic and non-genetic sources of similarity in these data.
              Inconsistent with claims (2) and (3), we show that familial

               implying that it cannot be a valid concept given this
               multiplicity of views. Second, she cites some research and
               opinion suggesting that ``EI has not been differentiated from
               personality plus IQ.'' Third, she states that ``the claim that
               EI determines real-world success has not been validated.''
               Finally, she proposes that research on brain function proves
               that there cannot be a ``unitary EI.'' Based on this critique,
               she argues that EI competencies should not be taught in the

              and is influenced by environmental factors",
  author   = "Sauce Silva, Bruno",
  abstract = "Among humans, estimates of the heritability of intelligence are
              high, although there is also evidence that this trait is quite
              malleable. However, little is known about the genotypes and
              environmental states that are relevant to intelligence, much less
              how they react together. This is in part due to limitations on
              work with humans, which are largely confined to assessing
              heritability and malleability using only correlational methods.
              In the past, our group has developed a battery of cognitive tasks
              in mice where the performance of individuals is correlated across
              all tests. Aggregate performance on this battery of tests
              predicts individuals' performance on other cognitive abilities
              implicated in human general intelligence such as reasoning and
              working memory. Thus it has been asserted that the ``general
              cognitive ability'' (GCA) scores obtained in this battery are
              analogous to human IQ scores. Here we attempted to answer a
              critical question: How much the individual differences in mouse
              intelligence can be influenced by genetics and the environment?
              To make these determinations, we used a strategy analogous to
              classic human twin/adoption studies. Unlike human studies, in the
              present case, different environments were under experimental
              control and thus could be administered differently to different
              members of sibling cohorts. We used 232 outbred male mice
              consisting of 58 families of 4 full siblings (fraternal twins)
              and provided different environments to the siblings from each
              family (analogous to ``twins raised apart''). For the
              environmental manipulation, half of the sibling groups stayed in
              a standard colony room with little stimulation, while the other
              half of the siblings were exposed to environments that are prone
              to influence cognitive development: physical exercise and daily
              exposure to novel experiences. Similar to our previous work, here
              GCA (i.e., intelligence) accounted for 19.5\% of the common
              variance in mice's performance from an exploratory factor
              analysis. We found that GCA was moderately malleable, with
              environmental enrichment increasing GCA scores by 0.44 standard
              deviations. In humans, this increase would represent an increase
              of 6.6 IQ points. Although here we used a combination of
              environmental factors that were likely to be effective, these
              were admittedly limited in scope and strength, and so GCA can
              potentially be more malleable than these results suggest. The
              population of all mice combined showed a GCA heritability of
              0.24, quite comparable to values estimated by others in rodents
              and non-human primates. To our surprise, our Enrichment group had
              a heritability not significantly different from zero, while our
              Control group had a moderate heritability of 0.55. This is the
              opposite of what is typically found in humans, where heritability
              is higher in populations drawn from higher SES environments.
              Also, unexpectedly, we did not find evidence for G$\times$E in
              our study. The results from the current study could help laying
              the groundwork for future studies on the independent effects and
              interactions between environment and genes in shaping general
              intelligence in humans.",

              coexist in hidden gene-environment interplay",
  author   = "Sauce, Bruno and Matzel, Louis D",
  abstract = "Intelligence can have an extremely high heritability, but also be
              malleable; a paradox that has been the source of continuous
              controversy. Here we attempt to clarify the issue, and advance a
              frequently overlooked solution to the paradox: Intelligence is a
              trait with unusual properties that create a large reservoir of
              hidden gene-environment (GE) networks, allowing for the
              contribution of high genetic and environmental influences on
              individual differences in IQ. GE interplay is difficult to
              specify with current methods, and is underestimated in standard
              metrics of heritability (thus inflating estimates of ``genetic''
              effects). We describe empirical evidence for GE interplay in
              intelligence, with malleability existing on top of heritability.
              The evidence covers cognitive gains consequent to
              adoption/immigration, changes in IQ's heritability across life
              span and socioeconomic status, gains in IQ over time consequent
              to societal development (the Flynn effect), the slowdown of
              age-related cognitive decline, and the gains in intelligence from
              early education. The GE solution has novel implications for
              enduring problems, including our inability to identify
              intelligence-related genes (also known as IQ's ``missing
              heritability''), and the loss of initial benefits from early
              intervention programs (such as ``Head Start''). The GE solution
              can be a powerful guide to future research, and may also aid
              policies to overcome barriers to the development of intelligence,
              particularly in impoverished and underprivileged populations.

              intelligence (GI) and definitions of the terms intelligence,
              environment, and heredity. The author points out that, if genetic
              determinants operate, they must do so by setting an upper limit
              on attainable intelligence. Thus, environmental factors determine
              how close an individual comes to this attainable limit. Since
              environmental factors can never augment the limit, an individual
              with a high GI will be potentially prone to greater
              environment-induced shortfall than a person with a low GI. Also,
              intelligence actually refers to, among other things, the
              susceptibility of an individual to the environment. It is argued

  abstract = "Intelligence tests are widely assumed to measure maximal
              intellectual performance, and predictive associations between
              intelligence quotient (IQ) scores and later-life outcomes are
              typically interpreted as unbiased estimates of the effect of
              intellectual ability on academic, professional, and social life
              outcomes. The current investigation critically examines these
              assumptions and finds evidence against both. First, we examined
              whether motivation is less than maximal on intelligence tests
              administered in the context of low-stakes research situations.
              Specifically, we completed a meta-analysis of random-assignment
              experiments testing the effects of material incentives on
              intelligence-test performance on a collective 2,008 participants.
              Incentives increased IQ scores by an average of 0.64 SD, with
              larger effects for individuals with lower baseline IQ scores.
              Second, we tested whether individual differences in motivation
              during IQ testing can spuriously inflate the predictive validity
              of intelligence for life outcomes. Trained observers rated test
              motivation among 251 adolescent boys completing intelligence
              tests using a 15-min ``thin-slice'' video sample. IQ score
              predicted life outcomes, including academic performance in
              adolescence and criminal convictions, employment, and years of
              education in early adulthood. After adjusting for the influence
              of test motivation, however, the predictive validity of
              intelligence for life outcomes was significantly diminished,
              particularly for nonacademic outcomes. Collectively, our findings
              suggest that, under low-stakes research conditions, some
              individuals try harder than others, and, in this context, test
              motivation can act as a third-variable confound that inflates

               factors so potent that they account for 15 of the 20 points

               •evidence on the stability of intelligence test performance by
               the same individual over a lapse of time. The content of the
               review will : be limited in two ways: (1) It is proposed to
               consider chiefly those reports which have appeared since 1930 or
               1931. The literature previous to that time has been covered by
               Nemzek (75), Foran (24, 25), and others. Earlier studies will be
               referred to only as this becomes necessary to understand recent
               trends of investigation. (2) It is proposed to limit this report
               primarily to those investigations in which the same individuals
               have been tested more than •once. Although studies of the
               resemblance of relatives, the intelligence level of occupational
               groups, etc. provide evidence concerning the relative weight of
               hereditary, as opposed to environmental, factors in producing
               differences in intelligence test performance, and consequently
               bear on the stability of the performance of the individual, it
               is not our purpose to try to cover this broader literature here.
               Certain general trends seem to appear in the type of
               experimentation reported within the last eight years, and it
               might be profitable to consider these briefly before going on to
               a survey of findings. In the period now being studied, the
               general fact of a rather high positive correlation between test
               and retest after an interval of time in children of school age
               seems to be fairly well taken for granted, and relatively few
               studies were found which were concerned merely with
               •demonstrating this point. Most studies try to push this finding
               forward in one or another of several directions, of which the
               following are rather typical: (a) attempts to get retest
               information on younger and younger children; (b) efforts to get
               retest data over longer periods of time; (c) efforts to

              approach has triumphed over environmentalism as an explanatory
              tool for variation in the cognitive ability and behaviour of
              humans. However, the entire debate is constrained by several
              fallacies described here. Heritability of a trait, does not
              predict the effect of environmental or genetic changes on the
              trait (Fallacy \#1), so knowing heritability does not assist in
              writing prescriptions for societal ills or budget cuts.
              Heritability estimates themselves are inaccurate, given the
              potential for gene-environment covariance and interaction, as
              well as other non-additive effects on behavior or cognitive
              ability (Fallacy \#2). The 'revolution in molecular genetics' has
              provided more effective tools for describing the genome, but
              doesn't permit separation of gene and environmental effects on
              traits (Fallacy \#3). If we were able to measure heritability
              accurately, it would give us absolutely no indication of whether
              or not group differences are genetically based (Fallacy \#4).
              Finally, any proposed models of the evolutionary divergence of
              human groups must more adequately answer the basic questions of
              such a study, and are not supported by high heritability in
              present populations (Fallacy \#5). Humans are not and should
              never be exposed to artificial selection and crossing
              experiments, so behavior geneticists will continue to be very
              limited in their ability to partition the effects of genes, the

               and Changing Paradigms",
  author    = "Burt, Callie H",
  abstract  = "Purpose: Heritability studies attempt to estimate the
               contribution of genes (vs. environments) to variation in
               phenotypes (or outcomes of interest) in a given population at a
               given time. The current chapter scrutinizes heritability studies
               of adverse health phenotypes, emphasizing flaws that have become
               more glaring in light of recent advances in the life sciences
               and manifest most visibly in epigenetics.
               Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on a diverse body of
               research and critical scholarship, this chapter examines the
               veracity of methodological and conceptual assumptions of
               heritability studies. Findings: The chapter argues that
               heritability studies are futile for two reasons: (1)
               heritability studies suffer from serious methodological flaws
               with the overall effect of making estimates inaccurate and
               likely biased toward inflated heritability, and, more
               importantly, (2) the conceptual (biological) model on which
               heritability studies depend---that of identifiably separate
               effects of genes vs. the environment on phenotype variance---is
               unsound. As discussed, contemporary bioscientific work indicates
               that genes and environments are enmeshed in a complex
               (bidirectional, interactional), dynamic relationship that defies
               any attempt to demarcate separate contributions to phenotype
               variance. Thus, heritability studies attempt the biologically
               impossible. The emerging research on the importance of
               microbiota is also discussed, including how the commensal
               relationship between microbial and human cells further stymies
               heritability studies. Originality/value: Understandably, few
               sociologists have the time or interest to be informed about the
               methodological and theoretical underpinnings of heritability
               studies or to keep pace with the incredible advances in genetics
               and epigenetics over the past several years. The present study
               aims to provide interested scholars with information about
               heritability and heritability estimates of adverse health

              calculations in recent behaviour research including behaviour

              axioms of the underlying, more general concept itself is
              presented. The starting point for testing the proclaimed
              universal validity of this concept stems from a fictitious yet
              realistic example taken from learning research. The theoretical
              result, based on the application of the conventional reasoning in
              this field, states that developmental processes--and learning is
              only one specific case out of an immense number of similar

              causally explained with sufficient reliability within the context
              of the heredity paradigm. On the contrary, an inherent
              inconsistency of the concept itself when applied to behaviour
              processes is demonstrated. Finally, a conceptual alternative
              involving a systems-theoretical approach to the problem is

  abstract  = "Richardson and Norgate have argued that two unwarranted
               assumptions underlie many of the conclusions drawn by adoption
               study researchers, namely that genetic and environmental
               influences on phenotypic variation are additive, and that
               adoption studies approximate a simple randomized-effects design
               in which genetic and environmental influences on variance do not
               contaminate one another. As they note, this issue is important
               because the primary conclusions of such studies -- that genetic
               variation accounts for a significant proportion of variation in
               psychological characteristics such as IQ -- have been widely
               accepted [Maccoby, 2001; Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 2002;
               Turkheimer, 2005]. To address the inappropriateness of the
               assumption of additivity, Richardson and Norgate refer to
               several works that support the ascendant view that biological
               and psychological characteristics are constructed during
               development, when genes interact with local environmental
               factors that can be influenced by the broader environment.
               However, it is worth noting that the literature in developmental
               biology is replete with findings that support this view, so much
               so that the earlier view that some genes are able to
               independently cause or contribute to developmental outcomes is
               effectively indefensible [Coen, 1999; Edelman, 1988; Keller,
               2000; Gottlieb, 1998; Jablonka \& Lamb, 2005; Lewontin, 2000;

               2002; Robert, 2004; Schaffner, 1998]. Because gene-environment
               interactions are now understood to drive the development of all
               of our characteristics, the assumption of additivity is never
               warranted [Nijhout, 2002; Robert, 2000]. Likewise, after
               reviewing the relevant data, Richardson and Norgate conclude
               that the assumption that adopted children's genes are
               uncorrelated with their adoptive developmental environments is

              the unbroken chain of excessive heritability claims for

              differences between the mean scores for groups lends plausibility
              to explanations of mean differences in terms of genetic factors.
              I show that heritability estimates and the statistical analysis
              of variance (AOV) on which they are based have limited relevance
              in exposing genetic and environmental factors operating within
              any single group or population. I begin with agricultural
              investigations, where replication of genetic types and control
              over environmental factors are possible, and highlight the
              difficulties of moving from AOV of observed traits to
              investigation of measurable genetic factors. The difficulties can
              only be exacerbated for human data sets, which are equivalent to
              a crop trial in which each variety is replicated in only one or
              two of the locations.",

  abstract = "This article examines eight ``gaps'' in order to clarify why the
              quantitative genetics methods of partitioning variation of a
              trait into heritability and other components has very limited
              power to show anything clear and useful about genetic and
              environmental influences, especially for human behaviors and
              other traits. The first two gaps should be kept open; the others
              should be bridged or the difficulty of doing so should be
              acknowledged: 1. Key terms have multiple meanings that are
              distinct; 2. Statistical patterns are distinct from measurable
              underlying factors; 3. Translation from statistical analyses to
              hypotheses about measurable factors is difficult; 4. Predictions
              based on extrapolations from existing patterns of variation may
              not match outcomes; 5. The partitioning of variation in human
              studies does not reliably estimate the intended quantities; 6.
              Translation from statistical analyses to hypotheses about the
              measurable factors is even more difficult in light of the
              possible heterogeneity of underlying genetic or environmental
              factors; 7. Many steps lie between the analysis of observed
              traits and interventions based on well-founded claims about the
              causal influence of genetic or environmental factors; 8.
              Explanation of variation within groups does not translate to
              explanation of differences among groups. At the start, I engage
              readers' attention with three puzzles that have not been resolved
              by past debates. The puzzles concern generational increases in IQ
              test scores, the possibility of underlying heterogeneity, and the
              translation of methods from selective breeding into human
              genetics. After discussing the gaps, I present each puzzle in a
              new light and point to several new puzzles that invite attention
              from analysts of variation in quantitative genetics and in social
              science more generally. The article's critical perspectives on
              agricultural, laboratory, and human heritability studies are

              cannot be lightly dismissed, nonetheless we remain profoundly
              ignorant of how that legacy plays out in any environmental

              does the preference among anthropologists for analyzing
              biological rather than behavioral phenotypes improve what
              heritability can reasonably say about the sources of human
              variation. This paper discusses the meaning of heritability, the
              methods for its estimation, the fallacies underlying its misuse,
              and its utility for inquiries in evolutionary anthropology and
              epidemiology. Progress in anthropological genetics will be
              realized through greater sophistication in study designs,
              including the measurement of environmental (physical and
              sociocultural) variation and the judicious choice of phenotypes

               report sizeable heritability estimates (∼50 percent) and minimal
               effects of the so‐called shared environment for crime and
               related outcomes. Reports of such high heritabilities for such
               complex social behaviors are surprising, and findings indicating
               negligible shared environmental influences (usually interpreted
               to include parenting and community factors) seem implausible

               studies---partitioning the effects of nature and nurture---is

               relationship between complex phenotype(s) (e.g., height) and up
               to millions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Early
               analyses of GWASs are commonly believed to have ``missed'' much
               of the additive genetic variance estimated from correlations
               between relatives. A more recent method, genome-wide complex
               trait analysis (GCTA), obtains much higher estimates of
               heritability using a model of random SNP effects correlated
               between genotypically similar individuals. GCTA has now been
               applied to many phenotypes from schizophrenia to scholastic
               achievement. However, recent studies question GCTA's estimates
               of heritability. Here, we show that GCTA applied to current SNP
               data cannot produce reliable or stable estimates of
               heritability. We show first that GCTA depends sensitively on all
               singular values of a high-dimensional genetic relatedness matrix
               (GRM). When the assumptions in GCTA are satisfied exactly, we
               show that the heritability estimates produced by GCTA will be
               biased and the standard errors will likely be inaccurate. When
               the population is stratified, we find that GRMs typically have
               highly skewed singular values, and we prove that the many small
               singular values cannot be estimated reliably. Hence, GWAS data
               are necessarily overfit by GCTA which, as a result, produces
               high estimates of heritability. We also show that GCTA's
               heritability estimates are sensitive to the chosen sample and to
               measurement errors in the phenotype. We illustrate our results
               using the Framingham dataset. Our analysis suggests that results

              estimating heritabilities using genomewide data from unrelated
              individuals. A drawback of this strategy is that population
              stratification can bias the estimates. Indeed, an environmental
              factor associated with the phenotype may differ among population
              subgroups. This factor being associated both with the phenotype
              and the genetic variation in the population would be a
              confounder. A common solution consists in adjusting on the first
              Principal Components (PCs) of the genomic data. We study this
              procedure on simulated data and on 6000 individuals from the

              birth cities, which are not genetically determined, but the
              heritability of which should be overestimated due to population
              stratification. We also analyse various anthropometric traits.
              The procedure fails to correct the bias in geographical
              coordinates heritability estimates. The heritability estimates of
              the anthropometric traits are affected by the inclusion of the

              We investigated this approach with simulated data and with data

  abstract  = "Abstract There is growing evidence that the complexity of higher
               organisms does not correlate with the ?complexity? of the genome
               (the human genome contains fewer protein coding genes than corn,
               and many genes are preserved across species). Rather, complexity
               is associated with the complexity of the pathways and processes
               whereby the cell utilises the deoxyribonucleic acid molecule,
               and much else, in the process of phenotype formation. These
               processes include the activity of the epigenome, noncoding
               ribonucleic acids, alternative splicing and post-translational
               modifications. Not accidentally, all of these processes appear
               to be of particular importance for the human brain, the most
               complex organ in nature. Because these processes can be highly
               environmentally reactive, they are a key to understanding
               behavioural plasticity and highlight the importance of the
               developmental process in explaining behavioural outcomes. Key
               Concepts: Humans possess fewer protein-coding genes than maize
               (i.e. corn) and about the same number as a nematode. There is
               now strong evidence that the complexity of higher organisms
               correlates with the relative amount of noncoding RNA rather than
               the number of protein-coding genes. Epigenetic processes are key
               to every aspect of human development from cellular
               differentiation to learning and memory. Epigenetic mechanisms
               provide an explanation on the molecular level as to how the pre-
               and postnatal environments can impact offspring's behaviour.
               Alternative splicing is one mechanism that enables the human
               body to create over 100?000 proteins with a genome that contains
               only 20?000 protein coding genes. Each gene in the human genome
               is not ?encoded? for the production of a single protein.
               Isoforms can have very different and even antithetical
               physiological effects. Alternative splicing patterns are
               modulated in response to external stimuli, such as
               depolarisation of neurons, activation of signal transduction
               cascades and stress. Post-translational modification supplements
               alternative splicing as a means of creating protein diversity
               with a limited number of protein coding genes. DNA is not the
               sole biological agent of inheritance.",

              the paradigms for genetic causality in biological systems are
              seriously confused. This paper examines some of the
              misconceptions, starting with the changing definitions of a gene,
              from the cause of phenotype characters to the stretches of DNA. I
              then assess whether the 'digital' nature of DNA sequences

              whether it is meaningful or useful to refer to genetic programs,
              and the role of high-level (downward) causation. The metaphors

              recent decades have limited or even misleading impacts in the

              to determine whether they support the existence of an important
              genetic component in behavioral and personality differences. The
              methods and conclusions of the MISTRA team are discussed in the
              context of earlier studies of separated identical twins. I argue
              that volunteer-based studies are biased toward greater twin
              similarity. In addition, the MISTRA research team did not publish
              or share raw data and case history information. Reared-together
              and reared-apart monozygotic twins share important environmental
              similarities not controlled for by comparing personality
              correlations. I propose an alternative control group consisting
              of biologically unrelated pairs of strangers matched on all

              twins. I conclude that the evidence from studies of twins reared

  abstract = "A previous paper (Joseph, 2000) discussed the lack of evidence
              supporting genetic influences on behaviors given the label
              ``attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (ADHD). Faraone and
              Biederman (2000) subjected this paper to a critical analysis,
              writing that Joseph's review ``is based on errors in scientific
              logic compromised by an incomplete review of relevant data.'' The
              present paper answers the most important criticisms by Faraone
              and Biederman. It is reiterated that possible genetic and
              environmental influences in both ADHD family and twin studies are
              confounded, and therefore no inferences about genetic factors can
              be drawn from these studies. In addition, several invalidating
              flaws of ADHD adoption studies are briefly reviewed. Problems
              with ADHD segregation analyses and molecular genetic studies are
              also highlighted. These studies were mentioned by Faraone and
              Biederman in the context of Joseph's alleged ``incomplete
              literature review.'' Additional topics include the
              appropriateness of using psychotropic drugs to treat children
              diagnosed with ADHD, past social and political misuse of the
              findings of genetic research, and alternative explanations for

  author   = "Joseph, Jay",
  abstract = "This article examines evidence cited in favor of the operation of
              genetic factors in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
              (ADHD). Like other psychiatric conditions, a belief in the
              genetic basis of ADHD is derived from the results of family,
              twin, and adoption studies. Because family studies are widely
              believed to be confounded by environmental factors, primary
              emphasis is placed on twin and adoption studies. ADHD twin
              studies depend on the validity of the equal environment
              assumption (EEA), which holds that the environments of identical
              (MZ) and fraternal (DZ) twins are the same. Here it is argued
              that however the EEA is defined, it cannot be accepted.
              Therefore, the greater similarity or concordance of MZ twins when
              compared to DZ twins is plausibly explained by environmental
              factors. Adoption studies constitute a third method for
              investigating the role of genetic factors in ADHD. It is argued
              that these studies are greatly flawed by factors including non
              blinded diagnoses and the failure to study the biological
              relatives of adoptees. After an examination of the total weight
              of evidence in favor of a genetic basis or predisposition for
              ADHD, it is concluded that a role for genetic factors is not

  abstract = "This paper discusses and analyses three articles appearing in a
              1942 issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry. In the first,
              neurologist Foster Kennedy argued that 'feebleminded' people
              should be killed (an act which he referred to as 'euthanasia').
              The rebuttal was written by psychiatrist Leo Kanner, who argued
              against 'euthanasia'. An unsigned editorial discussing these
              positions clearly sided with Kennedy: that 'euthanasia' would be
              appropriate in some cases, and that parents' opposition to this
              procedure should be the subject of psychiatric concern. The
              arguments are analysed and discussed within the context of
              eugenics and the murder of mental patients in Germany. Finally,
              the author points out that currently ascendant genetic theories

               due to the decades-long failure to uncover the genes believed to
               cause the major psychiatric disorders. Since 2009, leading
               researchers have explained these negative results on the basis
               of the ?missing heritability? argument, which holds that more
               effective research methods must be developed to uncover presumed
               missing genes. According to the author, problems with the

              movement. Throughout his long career he played a major role in
              promoting eugenic ideas and policies in Germany, including
              helping formulate the 1933 Nazi eugenic sterilization law and
              other governmental policies directed against the alleged carriers
              of genetic defects. In the 1940s R{\"u}din supported the killing
              of children and mental patients under a Nazi program
              euphemistically called ``Euthanasia.'' The authors document these
              crimes and discuss their implications, and also present
              translations of two publications R{\"u}din co-authored in 1938

              authors also document what they see as revisionist historical
              accounts by leading psychiatric genetic authors. They outline
              three categories of contemporary psychiatric genetic accounts of
              R{\"u}din and his work: (A) those who write about German
              psychiatric genetics in the Nazi period, but either fail to
              mention R{\"u}din at all, or cast him in a favorable light; (B)
              those who acknowledge that R{\"u}din helped promote eugenic
              sterilization and/or may have worked with the Nazis, but
              generally paint a positive picture of R{\"u}din's research and
              fail to mention his participation in the ``euthanasia'' killing

               240 adopted-away 16-year-old biological offspring, suggesting no

               estimates obtained from classical twin studies. The classical
               twin method rests upon the equal environment assumption (EEA),
               which holds that reared-together identical and fraternal twin
               pairs grow up experiencing equally similar environmental
               exposures. However, a review of prior twin studies shows that
               identical twins are more similar than fraternal twins on
               childhood exposures that are central to the etiology of
               psychosis. Such exposures include bullying, sexual abuse,
               physical maltreatment, emotional neglect and abuse, and general
               trauma. An additional assumption presented by twin researchers,

                  re-examination due to the decades-long failure of molecular
                  genetic research to uncover the genes presumed to underlie
                  psychiatric disorders, psychological traits, and some common
                  medical conditions. As currently dominant theories of genetic
                  causation come more into question, we will see a renewed
                  interest in reassessing the potential roles of genes and
                  environment in these areas. To illustrate the potentially
                  harmful and diversionary impact of emphasizing genetics over
                  the environment, the author tells a story in the form of a
                  parable. In this parable, the citizens of a medium-size city
                  are confronted with the task of dealing with a group of
                  arsonists who are systematically burning down several houses
                  each week. The Mayor argues that the best way to prevent
                  arson is to analyze the types of wood used to build the
                  city's houses, with an accompanying lack of interest in
                  arresting the arsonists. Her opponents argue that regardless
                  of the type of wood used, the city and its citizens should
                  prevent arson attacks by focusing attention on identifying
                  and arresting the arsonists. The Mayor's position prevails,
                  and the arson attacks continue for years to come at the same
                  time as researchers continue to study and analyze the wood
                  used to construct the houses. Informed readers will recognize

              passed in the United States but lacks specific provisions for
              hybrids. The eastern wolf is a newly recognized wolf-like species
              that is highly admixed and inhabits the Great Lakes and eastern
              United States, a region previously thought to be included in the
              geographic range of only the gray wolf. The U.S. Fish and
              Wildlife Service has argued that the presence of the eastern

              removing ESA protection (delisting) from the gray wolf across its

              is frequently asserted that Homo sapiens is monotypic and that
              what are termed races are nothing more than biological illusions.
              In this manuscript a case is made for the hypothesis that H.
              sapiens is polytypic, and in this way is no different from other
              species exhibiting similar levels of genetic and morphological
              diversity. First it is demonstrated that the four major
              definitions of race/subspecies can be shown to be synonymous
              within the context of the framework of race as a correlation
              structure of traits. Next the issue of taxonomic classification
              is considered where it is demonstrated that H. sapiens possesses
              high levels morphological diversity, genetic heterozygosity and
              differentiation (F(ST)) compared to many species that are
              acknowledged to be polytypic with respect to subspecies. Racial
              variation is then evaluated in light of the phylogenetic species
              concept, where it is suggested that the least inclusive
              monophyletic units exist below the level of species within H.
              sapiens indicating the existence of a number of potential human
              phylogenetic species; and the biological species concept, where
              it is determined that racial variation is too small to represent
              differentiation at the level of biological species. Finally the
              implications of this are discussed in the context of anthropology
              where an accurate picture of the sequence and timing of events
              during the evolution of human taxa are required for a complete

              that the heritability of intelligence does not differ across
              racial and ethnic groups in the United States. They claim their
              results challenge the Scarr-Rowe hypothesis and support the
              hereditarian position that mean differences in IQ among racial
              and ethnic groups are attributable to genetic differences rather
              than environmental disparities. In this reply, we outline severe
              theoretical, methodological, and rhetorical flaws in every step
              of Pesta et al.'s meta-analysis. The most reliable finding Pesta
              et al. report is consistent with the Scarr-Rowe hypothesis and
              directly contradicts a hereditarian understanding of group
              differences in intelligence. Finally, we suggest that Pesta et
              al. (2020) serves as an example of how racially motivated and
              poorly executed work can find its way into a mainstream
              scientific journal, underscoring the importance of robust peer
              review and rigorous editorial judgement in the open science era.",

                   of knowledge due to its active community of players, precise
                   behaviors, and long-term records of high-quality data. In
                   this paper, we perform an analysis of chess in the context
                   of cultural evolution, describing multiple cultural factors
                   that affect move choice. We then build a population-level
                   statistical model of move choice in chess, based on the
                   Dirichlet-multinomial likelihood, to analyze cultural
                   transmission over decades of recorded games played by
                   leading players. For moves made in specific positions, we
                   evaluate the relative effects of frequency-dependent bias,
                   success bias, and prestige bias on the dynamics of move
                   frequencies. We observe that negative frequency-dependent
                   bias plays a role in the dynamics of certain moves, and that
                   other moves are compatible with transmission under prestige
                   bias or success bias. These apparent biases may reflect
                   recent changes, namely the introduction of computer chess
                   engines and online tournament broadcasts. Our analysis of
                   chess provides insights into broader questions concerning

  abstract = "``Complex multicellularity'', conventionally defined as large
              organisms with many specialized cell types, has evolved five
              times independently in eukaryotes, but never within prokaryotes.
              A number hypotheses have been proposed to explain this
              phenomenon, most of which posit that eukaryotes evolved key
              traits (e.g., dynamic cytoskeletons, alternative mechanisms of
              gene regulation, or subcellular compartments) which were a
              necessary prerequisite for the evolution of complex
              multicellularity. Here we propose an alternative, non-adaptive
              hypothesis for this broad macroevolutionary pattern. By binning
              cells into groups with finite genetic bottlenecks between
              generations, the evolution of multicellularity greatly reduces
              the effective population size (Ne) of cellular populations,
              increasing the role of genetic drift in evolutionary change.
              While both prokaryotes and eukaryotes experience this phenomenon,
              they have opposite responses to drift: mutational biases in
              eukaryotes tend to drive genomic expansion, providing additional
              raw genetic material for subsequent multicellular innovation,
              while prokaryotes generally face genomic erosion. These effects
              become more severe as organisms evolve larger size and more
              stringent genetic bottlenecks between generations- both of which
              are hallmarks of complex multicellularity. Taken together, we
              hypothesize that it is these idiosyncratic lineage-specific
              mutational biases, rather than cell-biological innovations within
              eukaryotes, that underpins the long-term divergent evolution of
              complex multicellularity across the tree of life.",

              food-sharing patterns in bonobos (Pan paniscus), one of our
              closest living relatives whose rare out-group tolerance
              facilitates interaction opportunities between groups. We show
              that, as in humans, positive assortment supports bonobo
              cooperation across borders. Bonobo cooperative attitudes toward
              in-group members informed their cooperative relationships with
              out-groups, in particular, forming connections with out-group
              individuals who also exhibited high cooperation tendencies. Our
              findings show that cooperation between unrelated individuals
              across groups without immediate payoff is not exclusive to humans
              and suggest that such cooperation can emerge in the absence of
              social norms or strong cultural dispositions. Humans are very
              good at cooperating with others outside of our family, kin, and
              cultural groups. Although cooperation among individuals within
              groups is also common in other animals, doing so outside of such
              groups has rarely been observed. Samuni and Surbeck looked at
              cooperative behaviors such as grooming and food sharing in
              bonobos and found that individuals that cooperated more within
              their own group were also more likely to cooperate with those in
              other groups (see the Perspective by Silk). Furthermore, such
              cooperation was neither rare nor opportunistic. Social openness
              in one of our closest relatives suggests that our cooperativeness

              Test validity, therefore, has always been indirect, by

              assumed to be other criteria of intelligence. Job performance
              has, for several reasons, been one such criterion. Correlations

               However, there has been no empirical study yet that investigated

               predisposition for high mathematical ability are not nurtured to

               measured equivalently across groups or time, which is essential
               for meaningful comparisons. We conducted a systematic review of
               426 psychology articles with openly available data, to (a)
               examine common practices in conducting and reporting of MI
               testing, (b) assess whether we could reproduce the reported MI
               results, and (c) conduct MI tests for the comparisons that

               showed that only 4\% of the 929 comparisons underwent MI

  author   = "Amos, William",
  abstract = "Non-African humans appear to carry a few per cent archaic DNA due
              to ancient inter-breeding. This modest legacy and its likely
              recent timing imply that most introgressed fragments will be rare
              and hence will occur mainly in the heterozygous state. I tested
              this prediction by calculating D statistics, a measure of legacy
              size, for pairs of humans where one of the pair was conditioned
              always to be either homozygous or heterozygous. Using coalescent
              simulations, I confirmed that conditioning the non-African to be
              heterozygous increased D, while conditioning the non-African to
              be homozygous reduced D to zero. Repeating with real data reveals
              the exact opposite pattern. In African-non-African comparisons, D
              is near-zero if the African individual is held homozygous.
              Conditioning one of two Africans to be either homozygous or
              heterozygous invariably generates large values of D, even when
              both individuals are drawn from the same population. Invariably,
              the African with more heterozygous sites (conditioned
              heterozygous > unconditioned > conditioned homozygous) appears
              less related to the archaic. By contrast, the same analysis
              applied to pairs of non-Africans always yields near-zero D,
              showing that conditioning does not create large D without an
              underlying signal to expose. Large D values in humans are
              therefore driven almost entirely by heterozygous sites in
              Africans acting to increase divergence from related taxa such as
              Neanderthals. In comparison with heterozygous Africans,
              individuals that lack African heterozygous sites, whether
              non-African or conditioned homozygous African, always appear more
              similar to archaic outgroups, a signal previously interpreted as
              evidence for introgression. I hope these analyses will encourage
              others to consider increased divergence as well as increased
              similarity to archaics as mechanisms capable of driving
              asymmetrical base-sharing.",

  abstract = "The sequencing of Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes has yielded
              many new insights about interbreeding events between extinct
              hominins and the ancestors of modern humans. While much attention
              has been paid to the relatively recent gene flow from
              Neanderthals and Denisovans into modern humans, other instances
              of introgression leave more subtle genomic evidence and have
              received less attention. Here, we present a major extension of
              the ARGweaver algorithm, called ARGweaver-D, which can infer
              local genetic relationships under a user-defined demographic
              model that includes population splits and migration events. This
              Bayesian algorithm probabilistically samples ancestral
              recombination graphs (ARGs) that specify not only tree topologies
              and branch lengths along the genome, but also indicate migrant
              lineages. The sampled ARGs can therefore be parsed to produce
              probabilities of introgression along the genome. We show that
              this method is well powered to detect the archaic migration into
              modern humans, even with only a few samples. We then show that
              the method can also detect introgressed regions stemming from
              older migration events, or from unsampled populations. We apply
              it to human, Neanderthal, and Denisovan genomes, looking for
              signatures of older proposed migration events, including ancient
              humans into Neanderthal, and unknown archaic hominins into
              Denisovans. We identify 3\% of the Neanderthal genome that is
              putatively introgressed from ancient humans, and estimate that
              the gene flow occurred between 200-300kya. We find no convincing
              evidence that negative selection acted against these regions.
              Finally, we predict that 1\% of the Denisovan genome was
              introgressed from an unsequenced, but highly diverged, archaic
              hominin ancestor. About 15\% of these ``super-archaic''
              regions-comprising at least about 4Mb-were, in turn, introgressed
              into modern humans and continue to exist in the genomes of people

              ancestry in modern populations can be leveraged to better
              understand the interaction between our species and its archaic
              relatives. Resolving the interactions between modern and archaic
              human populations can be difficult, as archaic variants in modern
              populations have been shaped by genetic drift, bottlenecks and
              gene flow. Here, we investigate the distribution of archaic
              variation in Eurasian populations. We find that archaic ancestry
              coverage at the individual- and population-level present distinct
              patterns in modern human populations: South Asians have nearly
              twice the number of population-unique archaic alleles compared
              with Europeans or East Asians, indicating that these populations
              experienced differing demographic and archaic admixture events.
              We confirm previous observations that East Asian individuals have
              more Neanderthal ancestry than European individuals, but
              surprisingly, when we compare the number of single nucleotide
              polymorphisms with archaic alleles found across a population,
              Europeans have more Neanderthal ancestry than East Asians. We

              or intersect scans for positive selection with scans for
              introgressed genomic regions. Although widely used, approaches
              intersecting outliers are vulnerable to a high false-negative
              rate as the power of different methods varies, especially for
              complex introgression events. Moreover, population genetic
              processes unrelated to AI, such as background selection or
              heterosis, may create similar genomic signals to AI, compromising
              the reliability of methods that rely on neutral null
              distributions. In recent years, machine learning (ML) methods
              have been increasingly applied to population genetic questions.
              Here, we present a ML-based method called MaLAdapt for
              identifying AI loci from genome-wide sequencing data. Using an
              Extra-Trees Classifier algorithm, our method combines information
              from a large number of biologically meaningful summary statistics

              existing methods for detecting AI based on the analysis of
              simulated data and the validation of empirical signals through
              visual inspection of haplotype patterns. We apply MaLAdapt to the

              incorporating non-majority groups, which are often understudied.
              Many of today's minority populations historically practiced
              foraging lifestyles, which were the only subsistence strategies
              prior to the rise of agriculture and pastoralism, but only a few
              groups practicing these strategies remain today. Genomic
              investigations of Holocene human remains excavated across the
              African continent show that the genetic landscape was vastly
              different compared to today's genetic landscape and that many

              isolation among groups and geographic areas, but also genetic

  abstract = "Genomic and ancient DNA data have revolutionized
              palaeoanthropology and our vision of human evolution, with
              indisputable landmarks like the sequencing of Neanderthal and
              Denisovan genomes. Yet, using genetic data to identify, date and
              quantify evolutionary events---like ancient bottlenecks or
              admixture---is not straightforward, as inferences may depend on
              model assumptions. In the last two decades, the idea that
              Neanderthals and members of the Homo sapiens lineage interbred
              has gained momentum. From the status of unlikely theory, it has
              reached consensus among human evolutionary biologists. This
              theory is mainly supported by statistical approaches that depend
              on demographic models minimizing or ignoring population
              structure, despite its widespread occurrence and the fact that
              when ignored, population structure can lead to infer spurious
              demographic events. We simulated genomic data under a structured
              and admixture-free model of human evolution, and found that all
              the tested admixture approaches identified long Neanderthal
              fragments in our simulated genomes and an admixture event that
              never took place. We also observed that several published
              admixture models failed to predict important empirical diversity
              or admixture statistics, and that our model was best at
              predicting these statistics jointly. Our results suggest that
              models accounting for population structure are fundamental to
              improve our understanding of human evolution, and that admixture
              between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens needs to be re-evaluated in
              the light of structured models. Beyond the Neanderthal case, we
              argue that ancient hybridization events, which are increasingly
              documented in many species, including with other hominins, may
              also benefit from such reevaluation. Significance statement The
              idea that Neanderthals and some ancestral Homo sapiens
              populations interbred has gained momentum in the last two
              decades. Yet, this theory is mainly supported by statistical
              approaches that assume highly simplified models of hominin
              evolution. A major issue is that these methods have been poorly
              tested in the context of population structure, despite its
              widespread occurrence in many vertebrate species. We simulated
              data under a structured model and found that all tested methods
              identified spurious admixture events, suggesting a lack of
              robustness to population structure. Besides, our structured model
              was better at predicting several key genomic statistics than the
              tested admixture models. This suggests that admixture should be
              re-evaluated in the light of population structure, in hominins
              and beyond. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have

               cultura evolution is pre‐Darwinian, employing a developmental
               model of unfolding characterized by intrinsic directionality, by
               definable stages that succeed each other, and by some criterion
               of progress. It is arbitrary in its definitions of progress, and
               has had the political problem that a diachronic claim of
               cultural progress implies a synchronic differential valuation of
               present‐day cultures. The biological scheme creates an
               isomorphism between the Darwinian mechanism of evolution and
               cultural history, postulating rules of cultural ``mutation,''
               cultural inheritance and some mechanism of natural selection
               among cultural alternatives. It uses simplistic ad hoc notions
               of individual acculturation and of the differential survival and
               reproduction of cultural elements. It is unclear what useful
               work is done by substituting the metaphor of evolution for

              communication, and none to the underlying biological capacity;
              (2) the fossil and archaeological evidence does not inform our

               Culture Evolve?'' (History and Theory, Theme Issue 38 [December
               1999], 52--78), W. G. Runciman affirms that ``Culture Does
               Evolve.'' However, we find nothing in his essay that convinces
               us to alter our initial position. And we must confess that in
               composing an answer to Runciman, our first temptation was simply
               to urge those interested to read our original article--both as a
               basis for evaluating Runciman's attempted refutation of it and
               as a framework for reading this essay, which addresses in
               greater detail issues we have already raised. Runciman views the
               ``selectionist paradigm'' as a ``scientific''``puzzle-solving
               device'' now validated by an ``expanding literature'' that has
               successfully modeled social and cultural change as
               ``evolutionary.'' All paradigms, however, including scientific
               ones, give rise to self-validating ``normal science.'' The real
               issue, accordingly, is not whether explanations can be
               successfully manufactured on the basis of paradigmatic
               assumptions, but whether the paradigmatic assumptions are
               appropriate to the object of analysis. The selectionist paradigm
               requires the reduction of society and culture to inheritance
               systems that consist of randomly varying, individual units, some
               of which are selected, and some not; and with society and
               culture thus reduced to inheritance systems, history can be
               reduced to ``evolution.'' But these reductions, which are
               required by the selectionist paradigm, exclude much that is
               essential to a satisfactory historical explanation--particularly
               the systemic properties of society and culture and the
               combination of systemic logic and contingency. Now as before,
               therefore, we conclude that while historical phenomena can
               always be modeled selectionistically, selectionist explanations
               do no work, nor do they contribute anything new except a
               misleading vocabulary that anesthetizes history.",

               polygenic adaptation: adaptive changes in the mean of a
               multifactorial trait due to shifts in allele frequencies across
               many loci. In recent years, several methods have been developed
               to detect polygenic adaptation using loci identified in
               genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Though powerful, these
               methods suffer from limited interpretability: they can detect
               which sets of populations have evidence for polygenic
               adaptation, but are unable to reveal where in the history of
               multiple populations these processes occurred. To address this,
               we created a method to detect polygenic adaptation in an
               admixture graph, which is a representation of the historical
               divergences and admixture events relating different populations
               through time. We developed a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
               algorithm to infer branch-specific parameters reflecting the
               strength of selection in each branch of a graph. Additionally,
               we developed a set of summary statistics that are fast to
               compute and can indicate which branches are most likely to have
               experienced polygenic adaptation. We show via simulations that
               this method---which we call PolyGraph---has good power to detect
               polygenic adaptation, and applied it to human population genomic
               data from around the world. We also provide evidence that
               variants associated with several traits, including height,
               educational attainment, and self-reported unibrow, have been

              association studies (GWASs) have been used to detect and quantify
              polygenic adaptation in humans. Several studies have reported
              signatures of natural selection at sets of SNPs associated with
              complex traits, like height and body mass index. However, more
              recent studies suggest that some of these signals may be caused
              by biases from uncorrected population stratification in the GWAS
              data with which these tests are performed. Moreover, past studies
              have predominantly relied on SNP effect size estimates obtained
              from GWAS panels of European ancestries, which are known to be
              poor predictors of phenotypes in non-European populations. Here,
              we collated GWAS data from multiple anthropometric and metabolic
              traits that have been measured in more than one cohort around the
              world, including the UK Biobank, FINRISK, Chinese NIPT, Biobank
              Japan, APCDR and PAGE. We then evaluated how robust signals of
              polygenic score overdispersion (which have been interpreted as
              suggesting polygenic adaptation) are to the choice of GWAS cohort
              used to identify associated variants and their effect size
              estimates. We did so while using the same panel to obtain
              population allele frequencies (The 1000 Genomes Project). We
              observe many discrepancies across tests performed on the same
              phenotype and find that association studies performed using
              multiple different cohorts, like meta-analyses and mega-analyses,
              tend to produce scores with strong overdispersion across
              populations. This results in apparent signatures of polygenic
              adaptation which are not observed when using effect size
              estimates from biobank-based GWASs of homogeneous ancestries.
              Indeed, we were able to artificially create score overdispersion
              when taking the UK Biobank cohort and simulating a meta-analysis
              on multiple subsets of the cohort. Finally, we show that the
              amount of overdispersion in scores for educational attainment - a
              trait with strong social implications and high potential for
              misinterpretation - is also strongly dependent on the specific
              GWAS used to build them. This suggests that extreme caution
              should be taken in the execution and interpretation of future
              tests of polygenic score overdispersion based on population
              differentiation, especially when using summary statistics from a
              GWAS that combines multiple cohorts. \#\#\# Competing Interest

               based on family, adoption, and twin studies, schizophrenia was
               widely believed to be a genetic disorder. Extensive studies
               using linkage analysis, candidate genes, genome wide association
               studies [GWAS], copy number variants, exome sequencing and other
               approaches have failed to identify causal genes. Instead, they
               identified almost 300 single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]
               associated with altered risks of developing schizophrenia as
               well as some rare variants associated with increased risk in a

              schizophrenia is ~80\% heritable. The CTM rests on the
              equal-environment assumption (EEA) that identical and fraternal
              twin pairs experience equivalent trait-relevant environmental
              exposures. The EEA has not been directly tested for schizophrenia
              with measures of child social adversity, which is particularly
              etiologically relevant to the disorder. However, if child social
              adversity is more similar in identical than fraternal pairs in
              the general twin population, the EEA is unlikely to be valid for
              schizophrenia, a question which we tested in this study. Using
              results from prior twin studies, we tested if intraclass
              correlations for the following five categories of child social
              adversity are larger in identical than fraternal twins: bullying,
              sexual abuse, physical maltreatment, emotional neglect and abuse,
              and general trauma. Eleven relevant studies that encompassed 9119
              twin pairs provided 24 comparisons of intraclass correlations,
              which we grouped into the five social exposure categories.
              Fisher's z-test revealed significantly higher correlations in
              identical than fraternal pairs for each exposure category (z
              $\geq$ 3.53, p < 0.001). The difference remained consistent
              across gender, study site (country), sample size, whether
              psychometric instruments were used, whether interviewing was
              proximate or distant to the exposures, and whether informants
              were twins or third persons. Combined with other evidence that
              the differential intraclass correlation for child social
              adversity cannot be explained by evocative gene-environment
              covariation, our results indicate that the CTM does not provide
              any valid indication of genomic effects in schizophrenia.",

               decades after the Second World War. Eugenic ideology never
               entirely deserted academia, however, and in the twenty-first
               century, it is re-emerging into mainstream academic discussion.
               This paper aims, first, to provide a reminder of demography's
               early links with eugenics and, second, to raise awareness of
               this academic resurgence of eugenic ideology. The final aim of
               the paper is to recommend ways to counter this resurgence: these
               include more active discussion of demography's eugenic past,
               especially when training students; greater emphasis on critical
               approaches in demography; and greater engagement of demographers
               (and other social scientists) with biologists and geneticists,

  abstract  = "This paper performs a critical review of twin and adoption
               studies looking at possible genetic factors in criminal and
               antisocial behavior. While most modern researchers acknowledge
               that family studies are unable to separate possible genetic and
               environmental influences, it is argued here that twin studies
               are similarly unable to disentangle these influences. The twin
               method of monozygotic-dizygotic comparison is predicated on the
               assumption that both types of twins share equal environments,
               and it is argued here that this assumption is false. Adoption
               studies have been promoted as a better way of separating genetic
               and environmental influences. However, there is good reason to
               believe that adoption studies of criminal and antisocial
               behavior were confounded by selective placement factors. In
               addition, these studies suffered from bias and serious
               methodological errors. In spite of these problems, no adoption
               researcher claimed to have found evidence of a genetic
               predisposition for violent crime. It is coneluded that the
               weight of the evidence from family, twin, and adoption studies
               does not support a genetic basis for any type of criminal or
               antisocial behavior. The historical background of genetic

               genetic etiology underlying racial differences in measured

               the original study (Scarr \& Weinberg, 1976, 1977), we argued
               for beneficial effects on transracial adoptees' IQs and

              traits of an organism related to reproduction. However, not all
              of these traits - gamete type, chromosomal inheritance,
              physiology, morphology, behavior, etc. - are necessarily linked,
              and the rhetorical collapse of variation into a single term
              elides much of the complexity inherent in reproductive
              phenotypes. We argue that consideration of sex as a constructed
              category operating at multiple biological levels opens up new
              avenues for inquiry in our study of biological variation. We
              apply this framework to three case studies that illustrate the
              diversity of sex variation, from decoupling sexual phenotypes to
              the evolutionary and ecological consequences of intrasexual
              polymorphisms. We argue that instead of assuming binary or
              bimodal sex in these systems, some may be better categorized as
              multimodal. Finally, we conduct a meta-analysis of terms used to
              describe diversity in sexual phenotypes in the scientific
              literature to highlight how a more inclusive and expansive
              framework for multimodal sex can clarify, rather than cloud,
              studies of sexual diversity within and across species. We argue
              that such an expanded understanding of sex better equips us to
              understand evolutionary processes on their own terms, and that as
              biologists it is incumbent upon us to push back against

  author   = "Templeton, A R",
  abstract = "Many associations have recently been discovered between
              phenotypic variation and genetic loci, causing some to advocate
              what Robert Sinsheimer has called ``a new eugenics'' that would
              treat genetic ``defects'' in individuals prone to a disease. The
              first premise of this vision is that genetic association studies
              reveal the biological cause of the phenotypic variation. Once the
              responsible genes are known, the second premise is that we should
              focus upon changing ``nature'' rather than ``nurture'' by
              correcting the ``defective'' genes. The first premise is flawed
              because associations between genetic markers and phenotypes can
              be spurious, as shown by an example. Moreover, it is shown that
              using non-causative but associated genetic markers one at a time
              (the normal practice) can lead to incorrect predictions of
              disease risk for many individuals. Going from association to
              causation is a non-trivial step scientifically that has rarely
              been done in much of the human genetic research. Even when a
              particular locus does contribute to the phenotypic variation of
              interest, the first premise remains flawed because phenotypes in
              general arise from complex interactions among genes and between
              genes and environments as shown for genes associations with
              coronary artery disease (CAD). The ability of current molecular
              genetic tools to ``fix'' defective genotypes is extremely
              limited, but even if the technological problems could be
              overcome, the studies on CAD reveal no obvious ``defective'' gene
              to fix because the genetic effects are so context dependent (upon
              both other genes and environmental factors). Contrary to the
              second premise of the new eugenics, the more we learn about how
              different genotypes show variable responses to environments, the
              more important the environment becomes for individual treatment.
              The paradigm of a ``defective gene'' may work for classical
              Mendelian genetic diseases that are due to loss-of-function
              mutations. However, such mutations affect only a small portion of
              humanity. When the focus is changed to common disease and
              behavioral phenotypes, the ``defective gene'' paradigm is
              biologically meaningless and often harmful when applied to
              individuals. Thus, even when genes clearly do influence common
              phenotypic variation, the premises of the ``new eugenics'' are

               This Review argues that findings from studies of these traits

               experimental designs in model organisms are used to uncover the

               genetic architecture of quantitative traits is controversial,
               despite the biological plausibility that nonlinear molecular
               interactions underpin the genotype--phenotype map. This
               controversy arises because most genetic variation for
               quantitative traits is additive. However, additive variance is
               consistent with pervasive epistasis. In this Review, I discuss
               experimental designs to detect the contribution of epistasis to
               quantitative trait phenotypes in model organisms. These studies
               indicate that epistasis is common, and that additivity can be an
               emergent property of underlying genetic interaction networks.
               Epistasis causes hidden quantitative genetic variation in

               architecture and biological aetiology. Single-nucleotide

               a realistic biological model and that epistasis (that is, the

              Polymorphism (RFLP) autosomal loci is due to differences between

              continental groups account for only 10\% of the overall genetic
              variance. These findings conflict with popular notions of
              distinct and relatively homogeneous human races, and may also
              call into question the apparent usefulness of ethnic
              classification in, for example, medical diagnostics. Here, we
              present new data on 21 Alu insertions in 32 populations. We
              analyze these data along with three other large, globally
              dispersed data sets consisting of apparently neutral biallelic
              nuclear markers, as well as with a beta-globin data set possibly

              Y-chromosome loci. We also extend the analyses to address two
              questions: (1) whether differences between continental groups,
              although small, are nevertheless large enough to confidently
              assign individuals to their continent on the basis of their
              genotypes; (2) whether the observed genotypes naturally cluster
              into continental or population groups when the sample source
              location is ignored. Using a range of statistical methods, we
              show that classification errors are at best around 30\% for
              autosomal biallelic polymorphisms and 27\% for the Y chromosome.
              Two data sets suggest the existence of three and four major
              groups of genotypes worldwide, respectively, and the two
              groupings are inconsistent. These results suggest that, at random

              indispensable to get oriented in the ever-growing body of genomic
              data. Here we discuss the evidence based on which we can
              confidently state that humans are the least genetically variable
              primate, both when individuals and when populations are compared,
              and that each individual genome can be regarded as a mosaic of
              fragments of different origins. Each population is somewhat
              different from any other population, and there are geographical
              patterns in that variation. These patterns clearly indicate an
              African origin for our species, and keep a record of the main
              demographic changes accompanying the peopling of the whole
              planet. However, only a minimal fraction of alleles, and a small
              fraction of combinations of alleles along the chromosome, is
              restricted to a single geographical region (and even less so to a
              single population), and diversity between members of the same
              population is very large. The small genomic differences between
              populations and the extensive allele sharing across continents
              explain why historical attempts to identify, once and for good,
              major biological groups in humans have always failed.
              Nevertheless, racial categorization is all but gone, especially
              in clinical studies. We argue that racial labels may not only
              obscure important differences between patients but also that they

               effect is mainly, if not entirely, due to the large number of
               cell divisions in the male germ line. The mutation-rate increase
               is considerably greater than expected if the mutation rate were
               simply proportional to the number of cell divisions. In
               contrast, those mutations that are small deletions or
               rearrangements do not show the paternal age effect. The observed
               increase with the age of the father in the incidence of children

               result of different mixtures of base substitutions and

               Here, we highlight limitations in research on polygenic scores,

               genetic contributions to traits, as estimated by polygenic

               generally range from 75 to 85\%, with all heritability due to
               additive genetic influences, while genetic dominance and shared
               environmental factors are absent, or too small to be detected.
               These estimates are derived from studies based on the classical
               twin design and are based on the assumption of random mating.
               Yet, considerable positive assortative mating has been reported
               for general intelligence. Unmodeled assortative mating may lead
               to biased estimates of the relative magnitude of genetic and
               environmental factors. To investigate the effects of assortative
               mating on the estimates of the variance components of
               intelligence, we employed an extended twin-family design.
               Psychometric IQ data were available for adult monozygotic and
               dizygotic twins, their siblings, the partners of the twins and
               siblings, and either the parents or the adult offspring of the
               twins and siblings (N = 1314). Two underlying processes of
               assortment were considered: phenotypic assortment and social
               homogamy. The phenotypic assortment model was slightly preferred
               over the social homogamy model, suggesting that assortment for
               intelligence is mostly due to a selection of mates on similarity
               in intelligence. Under the preferred phenotypic assortment
               model, the variance of intelligence in adulthood was not only
               due to non-shared environmental (18\%) and additive genetic
               factors (44\%) but also to non-additive genetic factors (27\%)
               and phenotypic assortment (11\%).This non-additive nature of
               genetic influences on intelligence needs to be accommodated in

              scholars have sought to understand the role of heredity in human
              behavior and life-course outcomes. Recently, technological
              advances and the rapid expansion of genomic databases have
              facilitated the discovery of genes associated with human
              phenotypes like educational attainment and substance use
              disorders. To maximize the potential of this flourishing science,
              and to minimize potential harms, careful analysis of what it
              would mean for genes to be causes of human behavior is needed. In
              this paper, we advance a framework for identifying instances of
              genetic causes, interpreting those causal relationships, and
              applying them to advance causal knowledge more generally in the
              social sciences. Central to thinking about genes as causes is
              counterfactual reasoning, the cornerstone of causal thinking in
              statistics, medicine, and philosophy. We argue that within-family
              genetic effects represent the product of a counterfactual
              comparison in the same way as average treatment effects from
              randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Both average treatment
              effects from RCTs and within-family genetic effects are shallow
              causes: they operate within intricate causal systems
              (non-unitary), produce heterogeneous effects across individuals

              knowledge can be used to improve understanding of the etiology of

  abstract  = "The classical twin method - comprising comparisons of
               monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins - in the domain of
               cognitive abilities and attainments has led to wide acceptance
               of results suggesting a large amount of additive genetic
               variance, with far-reaching implications both for the nature of
               future studies on the causes of cognitive variance and for
               intervention policies, as in education. However, this
               interpretation is only valid if the method observes a number of
               conditions, which have to hold. Here, we show that the most
               crucial of these, namely, the equal environments assumption
               (EEA), may not hold. Consequently, differences in twin
               correlations might be at least partly explained by treatment
               effects from parents, teachers, peers, and so on. In addition,
               well-known interactions at various levels confound the model of
               simple additive effects on which the classical twin method is
               predicated and results are interpreted. For example, at a
               socio-cognitive level, DZ twins may respond to treatments
               differently from MZ twins. This interaction may further explain
               MZ-DZ correlation differences. There is abundant evidence for
               such interactive effects in published twin data. We suggest that

               populations as a way to answer questions about race has
               intensified in light of recent advances in genome technology.
               The purpose of this article is to apply a method of generalized
               hierarchical modeling to two DNA data sets. The first data set
               consists of a small sample of individuals (n = 32 total, from
               eight populations) who have been fully resequenced for 63 loci
               that encode a total of 38,534 base pairs. The second data set
               consists of a large sample of individuals (n = 928 total, from
               46 populations) who have been genotyped at 580 loci that encode
               short tandem repeats. The results are clear and somewhat
               surprising. We see that populations differ in the amount of
               diversity that they harbor. The pattern of DNA diversity is one
               of nested subsets, such that the diversity in non-Sub-Saharan
               African populations is essentially a subset of the diversity
               found in Sub-Saharan African populations. The actual pattern of
               DNA diversity creates some unsettling problems for using race as
               meaningful genetic categories. For example, the pattern of DNA
               diversity implies that some populations belong to more than one
               race (e.g., Europeans), whereas other populations do not belong
               to any race at all (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africans). As Frank
               Livingstone noted long ago, the Linnean classification system
               cannot accommodate this pattern because within the system a
               population cannot belong to more than one named group within a
               taxonomic level.",

               adoptees' IQs that East Asian adoptees raised in the West by

               adoptees raised by Whites have higher IQs than Black adoptees
               raised by Whites. Those publications suggest that this is
               because genetic differences give East Asians a higher mean IQ
               than Whites, and Whites a higher mean IQ than Blacks. This paper
               proposes a parsimonious alternative explanation: the apparent IQ

               when one allows for attrition in the Minnesota Transracial

               Asian, White, and Black adoptees raised in the same environment

               incomplete cross-fostering designs1--3 have indicated an effect

               Findings indicate that while the traditionally adopted Ss

               nearly 1 standard deviation Full-Scale Scoring advantage over
               them. A multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) indicated
               significant differences in the styles of responding to test

               shows that the genetic effect is reflected by psychometric g to
               a greater degree than is the environmental effect, a finding
               consistent with the hypothesis that the g factor largely
               reflects the genetic component of variance in cognitive tests.
               These data also extend previous findings on Spearman's
               hypothesis that the standardized mean white-black (W-B)
               difference on various tests is directly related to the tests' g
               loadings. It was found that the profile of the mean W-B
               differences on various subtests of the WISC-R (in the U.S.
               standardization sample) is more similar to the profile of
               genetic effects on the subtest scores than to the profile of
               environmental effects, as measured in the adoption study.",

               rate for a prokaryote with an exceptionally small genome and for
               a unicellular eukaryote with a large genome. Combined with prior

               unifying explanation for the wide range in mutation rates that

               interactions, for example transcription factors and their DNA
               binding sites, microRNAs and their RNA binding sites, the
               interfaces between heterodimeric protein molecules, the stems in
               RNA molecules, and kinases and their response regulators in
               signal-transduction systems. Despite the need for
               complementarity between interacting partners, such pairwise
               systems seem to be capable of high levels of evolutionary
               divergence, even when subject to strong selection. Such behavior
               is a consequence of the diminishing advantages of increasing
               binding affinity between partners, the multiplicity of
               evolutionary pathways between selectively equivalent
               alternatives, and the stochastic nature of evolutionary
               processes. Because mutation pressure toward reduced affinity

               situations can arise in which the expected distribution of the
               degree of matching between interacting partners is bimodal, even
               in the face of constant selection. Although biomolecules with

              (demographic and geographic) expansion that began approximately
              45,000 to 60,000 y ago in Africa and rapidly resulted in human
              occupation of almost all of the Earth's habitable regions.
              Genomic data from contemporary humans suggest that this expansion
              was accompanied by a continuous loss of genetic diversity, a
              result of what is called the ``serial founder effect.'' In
              addition to genomic data, the serial founder effect model is now
              supported by the genetics of human parasites, morphology, and
              linguistics. This particular population history gave rise to the
              two defining features of genetic variation in humans: genomes
              from the substructured populations of Africa retain an
              exceptional number of unique variants, and there is a dramatic
              reduction in genetic diversity within populations living outside
              of Africa. These two patterns are relevant for medical genetic
              studies mapping genotypes to phenotypes and for inferring the
              power of natural selection in human history. It should be
              appreciated that the initial expansion and subsequent serial
              founder effect were determined by demographic and sociocultural
              factors associated with hunter-gatherer populations. How do we
              reconcile this major demic expansion with the population

               adaptations, the fact that experimental manipulation can often
               result in improvements in cellular infrastructure raises the
               question as to what ultimately limits the level of molecular

               that random genetic drift can impose a strong barrier to the
               advancement of molecular refinements by adaptive processes.
               Moreover, although substantial improvements in fitness may
               sometimes be accomplished via the emergence of novel cellular
               features that improve on previously established mechanisms, such

               increased molecular/cellular complexity can arise by Darwinian

               and often of the Michaelis-Menten form. The result is that, when
               natural selection favors increased enzyme activity so as to
               maximize flux, a point of diminishing returns will be attained
               in which any increase in flux results in a disproportionately
               small increase in fitness. Enzyme activity ultimately will reach
               a level at which the favorable effect of an increase in activity
               is of the order 1/(4Ne) or smaller, where Ne is the effective
               population number. At this point, many mutations that result in
               small changes in activity will result in negligible changes in
               fitness and will be selectively nearly neutral. We propose that
               this process is a mechanism whereby conditions for the

               varies in a way that reflects the sequence of migrations by
               which people spread throughout the world. Beyond its use in
               human evolutionary genetics, worldwide variation in genetic
               diversity sometimes can interact with social processes to
               produce differences among populations in their relationship to
               modern societal problems. We review the consequences of genetic
               diversity differences in the settings of familial identification
               in forensic genetic testing, match probabilities in bone marrow
               transplantation, and representation in genome-wide association
               studies of disease. In each of these three cases, the
               contribution of genetic diversity to social differences follows
               from population-genetic principles. For a fourth setting that is
               not similarly grounded, we reanalyze with expanded genetic data
               a report that genetic diversity differences influence global
               patterns of human economic development, finding no support for
               the claim. The four examples describe a limit to the importance
               of genetic diversity for explaining societal differences while
               illustrating a distinction that certain biologically based
               scenarios do require consideration of genetic diversity for

  abstract  = "Researchers in many fields have considered the meaning of two
               results about genetic variation for concepts of ``race.'' First,
               at most genetic loci, apportionments of human genetic diversity
               find that worldwide populations are genetically similar. Second,
               when multiple genetic loci are examined, it is possible to
               distinguish people with ancestry from different geographical
               regions. These two results raise an important question about
               human phenotypic diversity: To what extent do populations
               typically differ on phenotypes determined by multiple genetic
               loci? It might be expected that such phenotypes follow the
               pattern of similarity observed at individual loci.
               Alternatively, because they have a multilocus genetic
               architecture, they might follow the pattern of greater
               differentiation suggested by multilocus ancestry inference. To
               address the question, we extend a well-known classification
               model of Edwards (2003) by adding a selectively neutral
               quantitative trait. Using the extended model, we show, in line
               with previous work in quantitative genetics, that regardless of
               how many genetic loci influence the trait, one neutral trait is
               approximately as informative about ancestry as a single genetic
               locus. The results support the relevance of single-locus

               PC estimated on the basis of allele frequency variation at the
               geographic sampling locations of a set of populations, are often
               used to investigate the properties of past range expansions.
               Some studies have argued that in a range expansion, the axis of
               greatest variation (i.e., the first PC) is parallel to the axis
               of expansion. In contrast, others have identified a pattern in
               which the axis of greatest variation is perpendicular to the

               in outcomes by investigating the effect of the geographic
               sampling scheme on the direction of the axis of greatest
               variation under a two-dimensional range expansion model. From

               maps for the first PC. We find that depending on the geographic

               a predominant role for long-range migrations and bottlenecks. It
               is unclear whether either of these views fully describes the
               global pattern of human genetic variation. In this article, we
               use a coalescent-based simulation approach to compare the
               pattern of neutral genetic variation predicted by these views to
               the observed pattern estimated from neutral autosomal
               microsatellites assayed in 1,032 individuals from 53
               globally-distributed populations. We find that neither view
               predicts every aspect of the observed pattern of variation on
               its own, but that a combination of the two does. Specifically,
               we demonstrate that the observed pattern of global gene identity
               variation is consistent with a history of serial population
               fissions, bottlenecks and long-range migrations associated with
               the peopling of major geographic regions, and gene flow between

               described a key feature of human genetic diversity that would
               have profound impacts on conversations regarding genetics and
               race: the typical genetic locus varies much less between
               classical human race groupings than one might infer from
               inspecting the features historically used to define those races,
               like skin pigmentation. From this, Lewontin concluded: 'Human
               racial classification … is now seen to be of virtually no
               genetic or taxonomic significance' (p. 397). Here, 50 years
               after the paper's publication, the goal is to understand the
               origins and legacy of the paper. Aided by insights from

               taxonomy is unjustified. Three decades later, Edwards
               demonstrated that while the accuracy with which individuals may
               be assigned to groups is poor for a single locus, consideration
               of multi-locus data allows for highly accurate assignments.
               Edwards concluded that Lewontin's dismissal of racial taxonomy
               was unwarranted. Edwards misidentified the aim of Lewontin's
               critique, which was directed at the utility of racial

               number of polymorphic loci. This article explains why. Our
               analysis focuses on the frequency, omega, with which a pair of
               random individuals from two different populations is genetically
               more similar than a pair of individuals randomly selected from
               any single population. We compare omega to the error rates of
               several classification methods, using data sets that vary in
               number of loci, average allele frequency, populations sampled,
               and polymorphism ascertainment strategy. We demonstrate that
               classification methods achieve higher discriminatory power than
               omega because of their use of aggregate properties of
               populations. The number of loci analyzed is the most critical
               variable: with 100 polymorphisms, accurate classification is
               possible, but omega remains sizable, even when using populations
               as distinct as sub-Saharan Africans and Europeans. Phenotypes
               controlled by a dozen or fewer loci can therefore be expected to
               show substantial overlap between human populations. This
               provides empirical justification for caution when using
               population labels in biomedical settings, with broad
               implications for personalized medicine, pharmacogenetics, and
               the meaning of race.",

  abstract  = "A key challenge in human genetics is to understand the
               geographic distribution of human genetic variation. Often
               genetic variation is described by showing relationships among
               populations or individuals, drawing inferences over many
               variants. Here, we introduce an alternative representation of
               genetic variation that reveals the relative abundance of
               different allele frequency patterns. This approach allows
               viewers to easily see several features of human genetic
               structure: (1) most variants are rare and geographically
               localized, (2) variants that are common in a single geographic
               region are more likely to be shared across the globe than to be
               private to that region, and (3) where two individuals differ, it
               is most often due to variants that are found globally,
               regardless of whether the individuals are from the same region
               or different regions. Our variant-centric visualization
               clarifies the geographic patterns of human variation and can
               help address misconceptions about genetic differentiation among

  abstract = "In his famous 1972 paper, Richard Lewontin used 'classical'
              protein-based markers to show that greater than 85\% of human
              genetic diversity was contained within, rather than between,
              populations. At that time, these same markers also formed the
              basis of forensic technology aiming to identify individuals. This
              review describes the evolution of forensic genetic methods into
              DNA profiling, and how the field has accounted for the
              apportionment of genetic diversity in considering the weight of
              forensic evidence. When investigative databases fail to provide a
              match to a crime-scene profile, specific markers can be used to
              seek intelligence about a suspect: these include inferences on
              population of origin (biogeographic ancestry) and externally
              visible characteristics, chiefly pigmentation of skin, hair and
              eyes. In this endeavour, ancestry and phenotypic variation are
              closely entangled. The markers used show patterns of inter- and
              intrapopulation diversity that are very atypical compared to the
              genome as a whole, and reinforce an apparent link between
              ancestry and racial divergence that is not systematically present
              otherwise. Despite the legacy of Lewontin's result, therefore, in
              a major area in which genetics coincides with issues of public
              interest, methods tend to exaggerate human differences and could
              thereby contribute to the reification of biological race. This

              summarized by Lewontin in his 1972 paper, 'The Apportionment of
              Human Diversity'. One evolutionary process that requires special
              attention in both population genetics and statistical genetics is
              admixture: gene flow between two or more previously separated
              source populations to form a new admixed population. The
              admixture process introduces ancestry-based structure into
              patterns of genetic variation within and between populations,
              which in turn influences the inference of demographic histories,
              identification of genetic targets of selection and prediction of
              complex traits. In this review, we outline some challenges for
              admixture population genetics, including limitations of applying
              methods designed for populations without recent admixture to the
              study of admixed populations. We highlight recent studies and

  title    = "Population differentiation of polygenic score predictions under

  abstract = "Given the many small-effect loci uncovered by genome-wide
              association studies (GWAS), polygenic scores have become central
              to genomic medicine, and have found application in diverse
              settings including evolutionary studies of adaptation. Despite
              their promise, polygenic scores have been found to suffer from
              limited portability across human populations. This at first seems
              in conflict with the observation that most common genetic
              variation is shared among populations. We investigate one
              potential cause of this discrepancy: stabilizing selection on
              complex traits. Counterintuitively, while stabilizing selection
              constrains phenotypic evolution, it accelerates the loss and
              fixation of alleles underlying trait variation within populations
              (GWAS loci). Thus even when populations share an optimum
              phenotype, stabilizing selection erodes the variance contributed
              by their shared GWAS loci, such that predictions from GWAS in one
              population explain less of the phenotypic variation in another.
              We develop theory to quantify how stabilizing selection is
              expected to reduce the prediction accuracy of polygenic scores in
              populations not represented in GWAS samples. In addition, we find
              that polygenic scores can substantially overstate average genetic
              differences of phenotypes among populations. We emphasize
              stabilizing selection around a common optimum as a useful null
              model to connect patterns of allele frequency and polygenic score
              differentiation. This article is part of the theme issue

  abstract  = "Homozygosity has long been associated with rare, often
               devastating, Mendelian disorders, and Darwin was one of the
               first to recognize that inbreeding reduces evolutionary fitness.
               However, the effect of the more distant parental relatedness
               that is common in modern human populations is less well
               understood. Genomic data now allow us to investigate the effects
               of homozygosity on traits of public health importance by
               observing contiguous homozygous segments (runs of homozygosity),
               which are inferred to be homozygous along their complete length.
               Given the low levels of genome-wide homozygosity prevalent in
               most human populations, information is required on very large
               numbers of people to provide sufficient power. Here we use runs
               of homozygosity to study 16 health-related quantitative traits
               in 354,224 individuals from 102 cohorts, and find statistically
               significant associations between summed runs of homozygosity and
               four complex traits: height, forced expiratory lung volume in
               one second, general cognitive ability and educational attainment
               (P < 1 $\times$ 10(-300), 2.1 $\times$ 10(-6), 2.5 $\times$
               10(-10) and 1.8 $\times$ 10(-10), respectively). In each case,
               increased homozygosity was associated with decreased trait
               value, equivalent to the offspring of first cousins being 1.2 cm
               shorter and having 10 months' less education. Similar effect
               sizes were found across four continental groups and populations
               with different degrees of genome-wide homozygosity, providing
               evidence that homozygosity, rather than confounding, directly
               contributes to phenotypic variance. Contrary to earlier reports
               in substantially smaller samples, no evidence was seen of an
               influence of genome-wide homozygosity on blood pressure and low
               density lipoprotein cholesterol, or ten other cardio-metabolic
               traits. Since directional dominance is predicted for traits
               under directional evolutionary selection, this study provides
               evidence that increased stature and cognitive function have been
               positively selected in human evolution, whereas many important
               risk factors for late-onset complex diseases may not have been.",

              diagnosis, treatment and prevention of these diseases. The
              initial phases of the programme focused on whole-genome
              sequencing of individuals with rich phenotypic data and diverse
              backgrounds. Here we describe the TOPMed goals and design as well
              as the available resources and early insights obtained from the
              sequence data. The resources include a variant browser, a
              genotype imputation server, and genomic and phenotypic data that
              are available through dbGaP (Database of Genotypes and
              Phenotypes)1. In the first 53,831 TOPMed samples, we detected
              more than 400 million single-nucleotide and insertion or deletion
              variants after alignment with the reference genome. Additional
              previously undescribed variants were detected through assembly of
              unmapped reads and customized analysis in highly variable loci.
              Among the more than 400 million detected variants, 97\% have
              frequencies of less than 1\% and 46\% are singletons that are
              present in only one individual (53\% among unrelated
              individuals). These rare variants provide insights into
              mutational processes and recent human evolutionary history. The
              extensive catalogue of genetic variation in TOPMed studies
              provides unique opportunities for exploring the contributions of
              rare and noncoding sequence variants to phenotypic variation.
              Furthermore, combining TOPMed haplotypes with modern imputation
              methods improves the power and reach of genome-wide association

  title    = "Twin studies with unmet assumptions are biased towards genetic
              heritability",
  author   = "Dalmaijer, Edwin S",
  abstract = "For a century [[1][1],[2][2]], studies of monozygotic and
              dizygotic twins have yielded estimates of trait heritability. The
              clever logic behind them is that while both types of twins share
              environments, their genetic overlap is different. Hence, larger
              trait correlations between monozygotic compared to dizygotic
              twins indicate heritability (nature), whereas similar
              correlations indicate shared environmental influences (nurture),
              and low correlations indicate shaping through non-shared
              environments (external influences and measurement error). While
              many have written on the assumptions that both types of twins
              share equal environments [[3][3]--[5][4]], and that parental
              genetics and environment are independent [[6][5],[7][6]]; fewer
              have put their data where their mouth is. Here, the impacts of
              unmet assumptions were investigated using a generative mixture
              model of twin phenotypes. The results indicated that violations
              of the equal environments assumption yielded large
              overestimations of heritability and underestimations of shared
              environmental influences. On the other hand, when parental
              genetics shaped twins' shared environments, only minor non-linear
              biases against heritability emerged. Finally, realistic levels of
              measurement error uniformly depressed estimates for genetic and
              shared environmental factors. In sum, twin studies are
              particularly susceptible to overestimation of genetic and
              non-shared environmental influences. This bias could explain why
              some traits, such as attitudes towards property taxes [[8][7]],
              show suspiciously high heritability without a biologically
              plausible mechanism. Particularly in the context of traits with
              convincing mechanisms of cultural transmission [[9][8]--[11][9]]
              and complex gene-environment interactions [[6][5]], researchers

               Evidence on Social Inequality in Early Schooling from a Twin

  abstract  = "This article bridges the literature on educational inequality
               between and within families to test whether high--socioeconomic
               status (SES) families compensate for low cognitive ability in
               the transition to secondary education in Germany. The German
               educational system of early-ability tracking (at age 10)
               represents a stringent setting for the compensatory hypothesis.
               Overall, previous literature offers inconclusive findings.
               Previous research between families suffers from the
               misspecification of parental SES and ability, while most
               within-family research did not stratify the analysis by SES or
               the ability distribution. To address these issues, I draw from
               the TwinLife study to implement a twin fixed-effects design that
               minimizes unobserved confounding. I report two main findings.
               First, highly educated families do not compensate for twins'
               differences in cognitive ability at the bottom of the ability
               distribution. In the German system of early-ability tracking,
               advantaged families may have more difficulties to compensate
               than in countries where educational transitions are less
               dependent on ability. Second, holding parents' and children's
               cognitive ability constant, pupils from highly educated families
               are 27\% more likely to attend the academic track. This result
               implies wastage of academic potential for disadvantaged
               families, challenging the role of cognitive ability as the
               leading criterion of merit for liberal theories of equal
               opportunity. These findings point to the importance of other
               factors that vary between families with different resources and
               explain educational success, such as noncognitive abilities,
               risk aversion to downward mobility, and teachers' bias.

              cognitive ability. We identified, from a complete national
              Swedish sample of male-male siblings, 436 full-sibships in which
              at least one member was reared by one or more biological parents
              and the other by adoptive parents. IQ was measured at age 18-20
              as part of the Swedish military service conscription examination.
              Parental educational level was rated on a 5-point scale.
              Controlling for clustering of offspring within biological
              families, the adopted siblings had an IQ 4.41 (SE = 0.75) points
              higher than their nonadopted siblings. Each additional unit of
              rearing parental education was associated with 1.71 (SE = 0.44)

              averaged 17 years old. At both times, 426 members of 93 families
              were studied; 398 were seen in person and administered the WAIS-R
              or WISC-R. IQ correlations were calculated for adopted and
              biological parent-child pairs, and for genetically related and
              unrelated siblings. Educational levels of birth parents were
              correlated with the IQ scores of their adopted-away children.
              Results show that biologically related family members tended to
              resemble each other intellectually more than did adoptive family
              members at both time points. IQ correlations for biological

              from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of education can
              modestly predict a person's educational and economic success.
              This prediction could signal a biological mechanism:
              Education-linked genetics could encode characteristics that help
              people get ahead in life. Alternatively, prediction could reflect
              social history: People from well-off families might stay well-off
              for social reasons, and these families might also look alike
              genetically. A key test to distinguish biological mechanism from
              social history is if people with higher education polygenic
              scores tend to climb the social ladder beyond their parents'
              position. Upward mobility would indicate education-linked
              genetics encodes characteristics that foster success. We tested
              if education-linked polygenic scores predicted social mobility in
              >20,000 individuals in five longitudinal studies in the United
              States, Britain, and New Zealand. Participants with higher
              polygenic scores achieved more education and career success and
              accumulated more wealth. However, they also tended to come from
              better-off families. In the key test, participants with higher
              polygenic scores tended to be upwardly mobile compared with their
              parents. Moreover, in sibling-difference analysis, the sibling
              with the higher polygenic score was more upwardly mobile. Thus,
              education GWAS discoveries are not mere correlates of privilege;
              they influence social mobility within a life. Additional analyses
              revealed that a mother's polygenic score predicted her child's
              attainment over and above the child's own polygenic score,
              suggesting parents' genetics can also affect their children's
              attainment through environmental pathways. Education GWAS

               between Black and White populations has persisted within

               claimed polygenic scores provide evidence that a significant

               and White populations are caused by genetic differences due to
               natural selection, the ?hereditarian hypothesis.? This study
               aims to show conceptual and methodological flaws of past studies
               supporting the hereditarian hypothesis. Materials and methods
               Polygenic scores for educational attainment were constructed for
               African and European samples of the 1000 Genomes Project.
               Evidence for selection was evaluated using an excess variance
               test. Education associated variants were further evaluated for
               signals of selection by testing for excess genetic
               differentiation (Fst). Expected mean difference in IQ for
               populations was calculated under a neutral evolutionary scenario
               and contrasted to hereditarian claims. Results Tests for
               selection using polygenic scores failed to find evidence of
               natural selection when the less biased within-family GWAS effect
               sizes were used. Tests for selection using Fst values did not

               claims are not supported in the least. Cognitive performance
               does not appear to have been under diversifying selection in
               Europeans and Africans. In the absence of diversifying
               selection, the best case estimate for genetic contributions to
               group differences in cognitive performance is substantially
               smaller than hereditarians claim and is consistent with genetic

               feature, now useful to an organism, that did not arise as an
               adaptation for its present role, but was subsequently coopted
               for its current function. I call such features ``exaptations''
               and show that they are neither rare nor arcane, but dominant
               features of evolution---though previously unappreciated in the
               context of the overly adaptationist neo-Darwinian theory. This
               article argues that exaptation overcomes the fallacy of human
               sociobiology, helps us to understand the major patterns of
               flexibility and contingency in life's history, revises the roles
               of structure and function in evolutionary theory, serves as a
               centerpiece for grasping the origin and meaning of brain size in
               human evolution, and thereby cries out for recognition as a key

               of the fraud charges posthumously leveled against the once
               eminent psychologist Sir Cyril Burt, Mackintosh and
               Mascie-Taylor asserted that statistical anomalies they detected
               in his social mobility data of 1961 provided crucial evidence of
               guilt. The anomalies included apparent departures from normality
               in some parts of the data, incommensurate cell totals, and
               suspicious uniformity within IQ bands across fathers and sons.
               It is shown here that the departures from normality were a
               natural consequence of unavoidable rounding when inverting the
               cumulative normal distribution to construct the class IQ bands
               used in the tables. Elementary procedures are given, known since
               at least the 1930s, which could have been used by Burt to
               simultaneously preserve both the normality of his IQ data and
               the desired population proportions of occupational classes.
               Other anomalies first noticed by the statistician Donald Rubin
               are explainable as artifacts produced by fixing marginal totals
               in the presence of rounding to IQ scores, then using the same
               weighting procedures to conform to margins. The grounds given by
               Mackintosh and Mascie-Taylor for finding fraud in Burt's social

              that Neanderthals mated with modern human contemporaries. As a

               interpretation of racial differences in intelligence, by
               critically reviewing studies of biological variables related to
               intelligence, studies of transracial adoptions, studies of
               racially mixed individuals, regression analyses, and statistical
               studies of between and within group heritability. Analyses of
               adoption data indicate that IQs are influenced by the
               characteristics of the adopting families when children are young
               but these influences fade over time as children approach
               adolescence. Transracial adoption data for young children are
               less persuasive with respect to the influence of the adoptive
               family on IQ than data on older adoptees. It is suggested that
               in order to provide decisive evidence against the genetic
               hypothesis, it would be necessary to demonstrate that children
               reared from birth by white adopted families have IQs that are
               determined by the characteristics of their adopted rather than
               their biological families. It is found that the regression
               effects for IQ are compatible with genetic influences on
               intelligence. The chapter concludes that there either are gaps
               in knowledge, inconsistent results, untested assumptions or

               genetic markers and DNA markers. Human skin color shows a high
               degree of variation among geographic regions, typical of traits

               level of geographic differentiation, skin color variation is

               sets are used to see if biological races exist in humans and in

               most commonly used biological concepts of race, chimpanzees are

               traits, such as skin color, have frequently been used to define
               races in humans, but such adaptive traits reflect the underlying
               environmental factor to which they are adaptive and not overall

               discordant groups. There are no objective criteria for choosing
               one adaptive trait over another to define race. As a

               of the recent scientific literature on human evolution portrays
               human populations as separate branches on an evolutionary tree.
               A tree-like structure among humans has been falsified whenever

               genetic diversity. Although the relationship between F(ST) and
               geographic distance has been interpreted in the past as the
               result of an equilibrium model of drift and dispersal,
               simulation shows that the geographic pattern of heterozygosities
               in this data set is consistent with a model of a serial founder
               effect starting at a single origin. Given this serial-founder
               scenario, the relationship between genetic and geographic
               distance allows us to derive bounds for the effects of drift and
               natural selection on human genetic variation.",

               traditionally is a geographically circumscribed, genetically

               patterns of geographical variation such that some combination
               will distinguish most populations from all others. To avoid
               making ``race'' the equivalent of a local population, minimal
               thresholds of differentiation are imposed. Human ``races'' are
               below the thresholds used in other species, so valid traditional
               subspecies do not exist in humans. A ``subspecies'' can also be
               defined as a distinct evolutionary lineage within a species.
               Genetic surveys and the analyses of DNA haplotype trees show
               that human ``races'' are not distinct lineages, and that this is
               not due to recent admixture; human ``races'' are not and never
               were ``pure.'' Instead, human evolution has been and is
               characterized by many locally differentiated populations

              (MISTRA) Science IQ study. To arrive at the conclusion that ``IQ
              is strongly affected by genetic factors,'' Bouchard and
              colleagues omitted their control group reared-apart dizygotic
              twin (DZA) IQ score correlations. Near-full-sample correlations

              reared-apart monozygotic twin (MZA) and DZA group IQ correlations

              that the study failed the first step in determining that IQ

              the researchers assumed that the MZA group IQ score correlation

              on unsupported assumptions by the researchers, and they largely
              overlooked the confounding influence of cohort effects. Bouchard
              and colleagues then decided to count most environmental

              these conclusions are erroneous due to large violations of the
              additivity assumption underlying behavioral genetics methods -
              that sources of genetic and shared and nonshared environmental
              variance are independent and non-interactive. This is compounded
              in some cases by the theoretical equation of the effective and
              objective environments, where the former is defined by whether
              siblings are made more or less similar, and the latter by whether
              siblings are equally subject to the environmental characteristic
              in question. Using monozygotic twin fixed effects models, which
              compare outcomes among genetically identical pairs, we show that

              adolescent academic achievement and verbal intelligence,
              violating the additivity assumption of behavioral genetic
              methods. Importantly, these effects would be categorized as
              nonshared environmental influences in standard twin models
              despite their roots in shared environments. These findings should

              Here we present results of the pilot phase of the project,
              designed to develop and compare different strategies for
              genome-wide sequencing with high-throughput platforms. We
              undertook three projects: low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of
              179 individuals from four populations; high-coverage sequencing
              of two mother-father-child trios; and exon-targeted sequencing of
              697 individuals from seven populations. We describe the location,
              allele frequency and local haplotype structure of approximately
              15 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1 million short
              insertions and deletions, and 20,000 structural variants, most of
              which were previously undescribed. We show that, because we have
              catalogued the vast majority of common variation, over 95\% of
              the currently accessible variants found in any individual are
              present in this data set. On average, each person is found to
              carry approximately 250 to 300 loss-of-function variants in
              annotated genes and 50 to 100 variants previously implicated in
              inherited disorders. We demonstrate how these results can be used
              to inform association and functional studies. From the two trios,
              we directly estimate the rate of de novo germline base
              substitution mutations to be approximately 10(-8) per base pair
              per generation. We explore the data with regard to signatures of
              natural selection, and identify a marked reduction of genetic
              variation in the neighbourhood of genes, due to selection at

  abstract  = "Since the 1920s, population geneticists have had measures that
               describe how genetic variation is distributed spatially within a
               species' geographical range. Modern genetic survey techniques
               frequently yield information on the evolutionary relationships
               among the alleles or haplotypes as well as information on allele
               frequencies and their spatial distributions. This evolutionary
               information is often expressed in the form of an estimated
               haplotype or allele tree. Traditional statistics of population
               structure, such as F statistics, do not make use of evolutionary
               genealogical information, so it is necessary to develop new
               statistical estimators and tests that explicitly incorporate
               information from the haplotype tree. One such technique is to
               use the haplotype tree to define a nested series of branches
               (clades), thereby allowing an evolutionary nested analysis of
               the spatial distribution of genetic variation. Such a nested
               analysis can be performed regarding the geographical sampling
               locations either as categorical or continuous variables (i.e.
               some measure of spatial distance). It is shown that such nested
               phylogeographical analyses have more power to detect
               geographical associations than traditional, nonhistorical
               analyses and, as a consequence, allow a broader range of
               gene-flow parameters to be estimated in a precise fashion. More
               importantly, such nested analyses can discriminate between
               phylogeographical associations due to recurrent but restricted
               gene flow vs. historical events operating at the population
               level (e.g. past fragmentation, colonization, or range expansion
               events). Restricted gene flow and historical events can be
               intertwined, and the cladistic analyses can reconstruct their
               temporal juxtapositions, thereby yielding great insight into
               both the evolutionary history and population structure of the

              demographic events that influenced patterns of genetic variation

              relationships among African hunter-gatherers, as the world's
              deepest population divergences occur among these groups, and that
              the deepest population divergence dates to 300,000 years before

               under models of positive selection acting on standing genetic
               variation and on multiple beneficial mutations-so-called soft
               selective sweeps-researchers have sought to identify these
               patterns in natural population data. Indeed, over the past two
               years, large-scale data analyses have argued that soft sweeps
               are pervasive across organisms of very different effective
               population size and mutation rate-humans, Drosophila, and HIV.
               Yet, others have evaluated the relevance of these models to
               natural populations, as well as the identifiability of the
               models relative to other known population-level processes,
               arguing that soft sweeps are likely to be rare. Here, we look to
               reconcile these opposing results by carefully evaluating three
               recent studies and their underlying methodologies. Using
               population genetic theory, as well as extensive simulation, we
               find that all three examples are prone to extremely high
               false-positive rates, incorrectly identifying soft sweeps under
               both hard sweep and neutral models. Furthermore, we demonstrate
               that well-fit demographic histories combined with rare hard
               sweeps serve as the more parsimonious explanation. These
               findings represent a necessary response to the growing tendency
               of invoking parameter-heavy, assumption-laden models of

               the 20th century was based on the idea that genes control most

               as polydactyly and eye colour to physiological conditions such
               as the A-B-O blood groups to mental and personality traits such

               the development of the eugenics movement-its rise and decline

               much speculation, strong evidence of the mechanisms by which
               these assemblies evolved is lacking. Here we use ancestral gene
               resurrection and manipulative genetic experiments to determine
               how the complexity of an essential molecular machine--the
               hexameric transmembrane ring of the eukaryotic V-ATPase proton
               pump--increased hundreds of millions of years ago. We show that
               the ring of Fungi, which is composed of three paralogous
               proteins, evolved from a more ancient two-paralogue complex
               because of a gene duplication that was followed by loss in each
               daughter copy of specific interfaces by which it interacts with
               other ring proteins. These losses were complementary, so both
               copies became obligate components with restricted spatial roles

               each paralogue lineage into the resurrected ancestral proteins
               is sufficient to recapitulate their asymmetric degeneration and
               trigger the requirement for the more elaborate three-component
               ring. Our experiments show that increased complexity in an
               essential molecular machine evolved because of simple,

               geographic distance from East Africa: a decrease in
               heterozygosity, an increase in linkage disequilibrium (LD), and
               a decrease in the slope of the ancestral allele frequency
               spectrum. Forward simulations of unlinked loci have shown that
               the decline in heterozygosity can be described by a serial
               founder model, in which populations migrate outward from Africa
               through a process where each of a series of populations is
               formed from a subset of the previous population in the outward
               expansion. Here, we extend this approach by developing a
               retrospective coalescent-based serial founder model that
               incorporates linked loci. Our model both recovers the observed
               decline in heterozygosity with increasing distance from Africa

               between neighboring populations and limited admixture between
               modern and archaic humans can be accommodated in the model while
               continuing to explain the three trends, a competing model in
               which a wave of outward modern human migration expands into a
               series of preexisting archaic populations produces nearly
               opposite patterns to those observed in the data. We conclude by
               developing a simpler model to illustrate that the feature that
               permits the serial founder model but not the archaic persistence
               model to explain the three trends observed with increasing
               distance from Africa is its incorporation of a cumulative effect

               researchers have claimed that very substantial differences in

               groups are traditionally defined. According to these
               researchers, African populations suffer severe cognitive
               deficits when compared to other modern humans. Philippe Rushton,
               particularly, places these claimed mental deficits in an
               evolutionary context, advancing environmental explanations for
               such deficits and asserting that such cognitive differences
               existed prehistorically as well. Such substantial cognitive
               differences should be evident in human behavioural patterns, and
               thus in the archaeological record. Archaeological data can thus
               be used to test these claims about human evolutionary
               development and modern human cognitive difference. Examination
               of the archaeological record does not support the claims made by
               these researchers. This suggests that regional differences in IQ

              biological types or races that evolved in isolation was
              unchallenged for centuries, but large-scale modern studies failed
              to associate racial labels with recognizable genetic clusters.
              Recently, the conclusions of those studies have been questioned
              by authors who argue that racial classification has objective
              scientific bases and is indispensable in epidemiology and
              genetics. However, no classification is useful if the
              classification units are vague or controversial, and no consensus
              was ever reached on the number and definition of the human races.
              The available studies show that there is geographic structure in
              human genome diversity, and that it is possible to infer with
              reasonable accuracy the continent of origin from an individual's
              multilocus genotype. However, clear-cut genetic boundaries
              between human groups, which would be necessary to recognise these
              groups as relatively isolated mating units which zoologists would
              call races, have not been identified so far. On the contrary,
              allele frequencies and synthetic descriptors of genetic variation
              appear distributed in gradients over much of the planet, which
              points to gene flow, rather than to isolation, as the main
              evolutionary force shaping human genome diversity. A better
              understanding of patterns of human diversity and of the
              underlying evolutionary processes is important for its own sake,
              but is also indispensable for the development of diagnostic and

  abstract  = "Most proteins assemble into multisubunit complexes1. The
               persistence of these complexes across evolutionary time is
               usually explained as the result of natural selection for
               functional properties that depend on multimerization, such as
               intersubunit allostery or the capacity to do mechanical work2.
               In many complexes, however, multimerization does not enable any
               known function3. An alternative explanation is that multimers
               could become entrenched if substitutions accumulate that are
               neutral in multimers but deleterious in monomers; purifying
               selection would then prevent reversion to the unassembled form,
               even if assembly per se does not enhance biological function3-7.
               Here we show that a hydrophobic mutational ratchet
               systematically entrenches molecular complexes. By applying
               ancestral protein reconstruction and biochemical assays to the
               evolution of steroid hormone receptors, we show that an ancient
               hydrophobic interface, conserved for hundreds of millions of
               years, is entrenched because exposure of this interface to
               solvent reduces protein stability and causes aggregation, even
               though the interface makes no detectable contribution to
               function. Using structural bioinformatics, we show that a

  abstract = "Constructive Neutral Evolution (CNE) is an evolutionary mechanism
              that can explain much molecular inter-dependence and organismal
              complexity without assuming positive selection favoring such
              dependency or complexity, either directly or as a byproduct of
              adaptation. It differs from but complements other non-selective
              explanations for complexity, such as genetic drift and the Zero
              Force Evolutionary Law, by being ratchet-like in character. With
              CNE, purifying selection maintains dependencies or complexities
              that were neutrally evolved. Preliminary treatments use it to
              explain specific genetic and molecular structures or processes,
              such as retained gene duplications, the spliceosome, and RNA
              editing. Here we aim to expand the scope of such explanation
              beyond the molecular level, integrating CNE with Multi-Level
              Selection theory, and arguing that several popular higher-level
              selection scenarios are in fact instances of CNE. Suitably
              contextualized, CNE occurs at any level in the biological
              hierarchy at which natural selection as normally construed
              occurs. As examples, we focus on modularity in protein--protein
              interaction networks or ``interactomes,'' the origin of
              eukaryotic cells and the evolution of co-dependence in microbial
              communities---a variant of the ``Black Queen Hypothesis'' which

              adaptations to the glacial climate of Pleistocene Europe or to
              the high mechanical strains produced by habitually using the
              front teeth as tools, while those of modern humans could be
              adaptations for articulate speech production. A few researchers

              concerning the effects of past changes in gene sequence on
              molecular function, organismal phenotype and fitness. We address
              this challenge by combining ancestral protein reconstruction with
              biochemical experiments and physiological analysis of transgenic
              animals that carry ancestral genes. We tested a widely held
              hypothesis of molecular adaptation-that changes in the alcohol
              dehydrogenase protein (ADH) along the lineage leading to
              Drosophila melanogaster increased the catalytic activity of the
              enzyme and thereby contributed to the ethanol tolerance and
              adaptation of the species to its ethanol-rich ecological niche.
              Our experiments strongly refute the predictions of the adaptive
              ADH hypothesis and caution against accepting intuitively
              appealing accounts of historical molecular adaptation that are
              based on correlative evidence. The experimental strategy we

  abstract  = "The fitness effect of mutations can be influenced by their
               interactions with the environment, other mutations, or both.
               Previously, we constructed 32 ( = 2⁵) genotypes that comprise
               all possible combinations of the first five beneficial mutations
               to fix in a laboratory-evolved population of Escherichia coli.
               We found that (i) all five mutations were beneficial for the
               background on which they occurred; (ii) interactions between
               mutations drove a diminishing returns type epistasis, whereby
               epistasis became increasingly antagonistic as the expected
               fitness of a genotype increased; and (iii) the adaptive
               landscape revealed by the mutation combinations was smooth,
               having a single global fitness peak. Here we examine how the
               environment influences epistasis by determining the interactions
               between the same mutations in two alternative environments,
               selected from among 1,920 screened environments, that produced
               the largest increase or decrease in fitness of the most derived
               genotype. Some general features of the interactions were
               consistent: mutations tended to remain beneficial and the
               overall pattern of epistasis was of diminishing returns. Other
               features depended on the environment; in particular, several
               mutations were deleterious when added to specific genotypes,
               indicating the presence of antagonistic interactions that were
               absent in the original selection environment. Antagonism was not
               caused by consistent pleiotropic effects of individual mutations
               but rather by changing interactions between mutations. Our
               results demonstrate that understanding adaptation in changing

  author    = "Moore, David S and Lickliter, Robert",
  abstract  = "In the predominately gene-centered view of 20th century biology,
               the relationship between genotype and phenotype was essentially
               a relationship between cause and effect, between a plan and a
               product. Abandoning the idea of genes as inherited instructions
               or blueprints for phenotypes raises the question of how to best
               account for observed phenotypic stability and variability within
               and across generations of a population. We argue that the
               processes responsible for phenotypic stability and the processes
               responsible for phenotypic variability are one and the same,
               namely, the dynamics of development. This argument proposes that
               stability of phenotypic form is found not because of the
               transmission of genotypes, genetic programs, or the transfer of
               internal blueprints, but because similar internal and external
               conditions-collectively conceptualized as resources of
               development-can be reliably reconstituted in each generation.
               Variability of phenotypic form, which is an indispensable
               feature of any evolving system, relies on these same resources,
               but because the internal and external conditions of development
               are not reconstituted identically in succeeding generations,
               these conditions-and the phenotypes to which they give rise-will

              scales of biological organization and play a central role in
              evolution by providing adaptive capacity at the population-level.
              Thus, the question of how evolution generates phenotypic
              variation within an evolving population is fundamental in
              evolutionary biology. Here we address this question by performing
              experimental evolution of an antibiotic resistance gene, VIM-2
              beta-lactamase, combined with diverse biochemical assays and
              population genetics. We found that neutral drift, i.e., evolution
              under a static environment, with a low antibiotic concentration
              can promote and maintain significant phenotypic variation within
              the population with >100-fold differences in resistance strength.
              We developed a model based on the phenotype-environment-fitness
              landscape generated with >5,000 VIM-2 variants, and demonstrated
              that the combination of mutation-selection balance and
              threshold-like fitness-phenotype relationship is sufficient to
              explain the generation of large phenotypic variation within the
              evolving population. Importantly, high-resistance conferring
              variants can emerge during neutral drift, without being a product
              of adaptation. Our findings provide a novel and simple
              mechanistic explanation for why most genes in nature, and by
              extension, systems and organisms, inherently exhibit phenotypic
              variation, and thus, population-level evolvability.",

               evolution of phenotypes, but current theories incorporate only a
               subset of these tradeoffs. Consequently, these theories cannot
               account for some of the variation in reaction norms that has
               been observed within and among species. Empirical studies of
               thermal reaction norms for physiological and life historical
               traits have shown that different proximate mechanisms can
               produce similar reaction norms. As a consequence, certain
               tradeoffs can be circumvented when the fitness costs imposed by
               these tradeoffs are severe. We argue that a unified theory that

  abstract = "Our understanding of population history in deep time has been
              assisted by fitting admixture graphs ('AGs') to data: models that
              specify the ordering of population splits and mixtures, which
              along with the amount of genetic drift on each lineage and the
              proportions of mixture, is the only information needed to predict
              the patterns of allele frequency correlation among populations.
              Not needing to specify population size changes, split times, or
              whether admixture events were sudden or drawn out simplifies the
              space of models that need to be searched. However, the space of
              possible AGs relating populations is vast and cannot be sampled
              fully, and thus most published studies have identified fitting
              AGs through a manual process driven by prior hypotheses, leaving
              the vast majority of alternative models unexplored. Here, we
              develop a method for systematically searching the space of all
              AGs that can incorporate non-genetic information in the form of
              topology constraints. We implement this findGraphs tool within a
              software package, ADMIXTOOLS 2, which is a reimplementation of
              the ADMIXTOOLS software with new features and large performance
              gains. We apply this methodology to identify alternative models
              to AGs that played key roles in eight published studies and find
              that graphs modeling more than six populations and two or three
              admixture events are often not unique, with many alternative
              models fitting nominally or significantly better than the
              published one. Our results suggest that strong claims about
              population history from AGs should only be made when all
              well-fitting and temporally plausible models share common
              topological features. Our re-evaluation of published data also
              provides insight into the population histories of humans, dogs,
              and horses, identifying features that are stable across the
              models we explored, as well as scenarios of populations
              relationships that differ in important ways from models that have
              been highlighted in the literature, that fit the allele frequency
              correlation data, and that are not obviously wrong.",

               and environmental influences on individual differences in
               behavior; and (3) use of measured genotypes to understand
               behavior. University of Minnesota scientists made significant

              than 100 sets of reared-apart twins or triplets to a week of
              intensive psychological and physiological assessment. Like the
              prior, smaller studies of monozygotic twins reared apart, about
              70\% of the variance in IQ was found to be associated with
              genetic variation. On multiple measures of personality and
              temperament, occupational and leisure-time interests, and social
              attitudes, monozygotic twins reared apart are about as similar as

              influencing the effective environment of the developing child.

               genetic--epidemiological studies of complex diseases and their
               potential relevance for clinical application. Although there are
               some important examples of interactions and applications, the

               for targeted intervention or personalized treatment

               clinical practice. We attempt to clarify conceptual differences

               human lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene was scored in three
               populations: African-Americans from Jackson, Mississippi (24
               individuals), Finns from North Karelia, Finland (24), and
               non-Hispanic whites from Rochester, Minnesota (23). Earlier
               analyses had indicated that recombination was common but
               concentrated into a hotspot and that recurrent mutations at
               multiple sites may have occurred. We show that much evolutionary
               structure exists in the haplotype variation on either side of
               the recombinational hotspot. By peeling off significant
               recombination events from a tree estimated under the null
               hypothesis of no recombination, we also reveal some cladistic
               structure not disrupted by recombination during the time to
               coalescence of this variation. Additional cladistic structure is
               estimated to have emerged after recombination. Many apparent
               multiple mutational events at sites still remain after removing
               the effects of the detected recombination/gene conversion
               events. These apparent multiple events are found primarily at
               sites identified as highly mutable by previous studies,
               strengthening the conclusion that they are true multiple events.
               This analysis portrays the complexity of the interplay among
               many recombinational and mutational events that would be needed
               to explain the patterns of haplotype diversity in this gene. The
               cladistic structure in this region is used to identify four to
               six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that would provide
               disequilibrium coverage over much of this region. These sites
               may be useful in identifying phenotypic associations with
               variable sites in this gene. Evolutionary considerations also
               imply that the SNPs in the 3' region should have general utility
               in most human populations, but the 5' SNPs may be more
               population specific. Choosing SNPs at random would generally not
               provide adequate disequilibrium coverage of the sequenced

               by APOE isoform genotype in African-American (AA) and

               with strong correlation between ln TG and TC while the e4 allele
               leads to little or no correlation. This led to a priori
               hypotheses that APOE genotypes affect the relationship of TC
               and/or ln TG with incident CHD. We found that APOE*TC was
               significant (P = 0.016) for AA but not EA while APOE*ln TG was
               significant for EA (P = 0.027) but not AA. In both cases, e2e2

               limitations in the current evolutionary framework with its
               intellectual roots in the Modern Synthesis (MS). Some radical
               critics even want to entirely abandon the current evolutionary
               framework, claiming that the MS (often erroneously labelled
               ``Neo-Darwinism'') is outdated, and will soon be replaced by an
               entirely new framework, such as the Third Way of Evolution
               (TWE). Such criticisms are not new but have repeatedly
               re-surfaced every decade since the formation of the MS, and they
               were particularly articulated by developmental biologist Conrad
               Waddington and paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould. Waddington,
               Gould, and later critics argued that the MS was too narrowly
               focused on genes and natural selection, and that it ignored
               developmental processes, epigenetics, paleontology and
               macroevolutionary phenomena. More recent critics partly recycle
               these old arguments and argue that non-genetic inheritance,
               niche construction, phenotypic plasticity and developmental bias
               necessitate major revision of evolutionary theory. Here I
               discuss these supposed challenges, taking a historical
               perspective and tracing the arguments by critics back to
               Waddington and Gould. I dissect the old claims by Waddington,
               Gould and more recent critics that the MS was excessively gene
               centric and became increasingly ``hardened'' over time and
               narrowly focused on natural selection. Recent critics have
               consciously or unconsciously exaggerated the long-lasting
               influence of the MS on contemporary evolutionary biology and
               have underestimated many post-Synthesis developments,
               particularly Neutral Theory, evolutionary quantitative genetics
               and the power and generality of the Price Equation. Critics have
               also painted a biased picture of the MS as a more monolithic
               research tradition than it ever was and have downplayed the
               pluralistic nature of contemporary evolutionary biology,
               particularly the long-lasting influence of Sewall Wright with
               his emphasis on gene interactions and stochasticity. I argue
               that some of the criticisms of the MS and contemporary
               evolutionary biology are primarily meta-scientific, revealing
               the underlying identity politics of critics when pushing their
               alternative research agendas. It is still unclear what their
               proposed alternative research frameworks would entail and why
               the existing theoretical framework is insufficient. Finally, I
               outline and visualize the conceptually split landscape of
               contemporary evolutionary biology, with four different stably
               coexisting analytical frameworks: adaptationism, mutationism,
               neutralism and selectionism. I suggest that the field can
               accommodate the challenges raised by critics, although
               structuralism (``Evo Devo'') and macroevolution remain to be
               conceptually integrated within mainstream evolutionary theory.",

               calling the biological sex into question, arguing that sex is a
               graded spectrum rather than a binary trait. Leading science
               journals have been adopting this relativist view, thereby
               opposing fundamental biological facts. While we fully endorse
               efforts to create a more inclusive environment for
               gender‐diverse people, this does not require denying biological
               sex. On the contrary, the rejection of biological sex seems to
               be based on a lack of knowledge about evolution and it champions
               species chauvinism, inasmuch as it imposes human identity
               notions on millions of other species. We argue that the
               biological definition of the sexes remains central to
               recognising the diversity of life. Humans with their unique
               combination of biological sex and gender are different from
               non‐human animals and plants in this respect. Denying the

              classifying traits (e.g. genetically specified versus owing to
              the environment) are inadequate. They have also revealed a
              variety of scientifically interesting ways of classifying traits
              each of which captures some aspect of the innate/non-innate
              distinction. These include things such as whether a trait is
              canalized, whether it has a history of natural selection, whether
              it developed without learning or without a specific set of
              environmental triggers, whether it is causally correlated with
              the action of certain specific genes, etc. We offer an analogy:
              the term 'jade' was once thought to refer to a single natural
              kind; it was then discovered that it refers to two different
              chemical compounds, jadeite and nephrite. In the same way, we
              argue, researchers should recognize that 'innateness' refers not
              to a single natural kind but to a set of (possibly related)
              natural kinds. When this happens, it will be easier to progress

              This paper stimulated a cottage industry of field studies of
              natural and sexual selection in nature and resulted in several
              large-scale meta-analyses, statistical developments and method
              papers. The statistical tools they suggested contributed to a
              breakdown of the traditional dichotomy between ecological and

              as ``eco-evolutionary dynamics''. However, regression-based

              that studies of selection and inheritance can fruitfully be
              decoupled and be studied separately, since selection acts on

              elevated levels of genetic diversity and substantial population
              structure. Importantly, African genomes are heterogeneous: They
              contain mixtures of multiple ancestries, each of which have
              experienced different evolutionary histories. In this review, we
              view population genetics through the lens of admixture,
              highlighting how multiple demographic events have shaped African
              genomes. Each of these historical vignettes paints a recurring
              picture of population divergence followed by secondary contact.
              First, we give a brief overview of genetic variation in Africa
              and examine deep population structure within Africa, including
              the evidence of ancient introgression from archaic ``ghost''
              populations. Second, we describe the genetic legacies of
              admixture events that have occurred during the past 10,000 years.
              This includes gene flow between different click-speaking Khoe-San
              populations, the stepwise spread of pastoralism from eastern to
              southern Africa, multiple migrations of Bantu speakers across the
              continent, as well as admixture from the Middle East and Europe
              into the Sahel region and North Africa. Furthermore, the genomic
              signatures of more recent admixture can be found in the Cape
              Peninsula and throughout the African diaspora. Third, we
              highlight how natural selection has shaped patterns of genetic
              variation across the continent, noting that gene flow provides a
              potent source of adaptive variation and that selective pressures
              vary across Africa. Finally, we explore the biomedical
              implications of population structure in Africa on health and

              humans around the globe can be traced into the deep past, and
              which ancestors it passes through during our journey back in
              time. We identify three key phases that are surrounded by major
              questions, and which will be at the frontiers of future research.
              The most recent phase comprises the worldwide expansion of modern
              humans between 40 and 60 thousand years ago (ka) and their last
              known contacts with archaic groups such as Neanderthals and
              Denisovans. The second phase is associated with a broadly
              construed African origin of modern human diversity between 60 and
              300 ka. The oldest phase comprises the complex separation of
              modern human ancestors from archaic human groups from 0.3 to 1

              currently be identified at which modern human ancestry was

              lack genetic data from the time when the first anatomically
              modern humans appeared, between 200,000 and 60,000 years ago,
              instead we exploit the phenotype of neurocranial geometry to
              compare the variation in early modern human fossils with that in
              other groups of fossil Homo and recent modern humans. Variation
              is assessed as the mean-squared Procrustes distance from the
              group average shape in a representation based on several hundred
              neurocranial landmarks and semilandmarks. We find that the early

              morphologically similar to recent modern humans of diverse

              Of the currently competing models of modern human origins, some

              continent-wide, gradual accumulation of complex material culture,
              the record exhibits a predominantly asynchronous presence and
              duration of many innovations across different regions of Africa.
              The emerging pattern of behavioral complexity from the MSA
              conforms to an intricate mosaic characterized by spatially
              discrete, temporally variable, and historically contingent
              trajectories. This archaeological record bears no direct relation
              to a simplistic shift in the human brain but rather reflects
              similar cognitive capacities that are variably manifested. The
              interaction of multiple causal factors constitutes the most
              parsimonious explanation driving the variable expression of
              complex behaviors, with demographic processes such as population
              structure, size, and connectivity playing a key role. While much
              emphasis has been given to innovation and variability in the MSA
              record, long periods of stasis and a lack of cumulative
              developments argue further against a strictly gradualistic nature
              in the record. Instead, we are confronted with humanity's deep,
              variegated roots in Africa, and a dynamic metapopulation that
              took many millennia to reach the critical mass capable of
              producing the ratchet effect commonly used to define contemporary
              human culture. Finally, we note a weakening link between 'modern'
              human biology and behavior from around 300 ka ago.",

              increasing recognition that population structure can generate
              genetic data similar to those produced under models of population
              size change. Recently, Mazet et al. (Heredity 116:362-371, 2016)
              showed that, for any model of population structure, it is always
              possible to find a panmictic model with a particular function of
              population size changes, having exactly the same distribution of
              T2 (the coalescence time for a sample of size two) as that of the
              structured model. They called this function IICR (Inverse
              Instantaneous Coalescence Rate) and showed that it does not
              necessarily correspond to population size changes under
              non-panmictic models. Besides, most of the methods used to

              arbitrarily fix that structure and to minimise or neglect

              Herbots (PhD thesis, University of London, 1994) on the

              Non-Stationary Structured Coalescent (NSSC) that incorporates
              demographic events (changes in gene flow and/or deme sizes) to
              models of nearly any complexity. We show how to compute the IICR
              under a wide family of stationary and non-stationary models. As

               heritability of 11 quantitative and 12 dichotomous phenotypes in
               a sample of 38,167 individuals. Most previous estimates of
               heritability are derived from family-based approaches such as
               twin studies, which may be biased upwards by epistatic
               interactions or shared environment. Our estimates of
               heritability, based on both closely and distantly related pairs
               of individuals, are significantly lower than those from previous
               studies. We examine phenotypic correlations across a range of
               relationships, from siblings to first cousins, and find that the
               excess phenotypic correlation in these related individuals is
               predominantly due to shared environment as opposed to dominance
               or epistasis. We also develop a new method to jointly estimate

              originated within Africa, considerable uncertainty surrounds
              specific models of divergence and migration across the continent.
              Progress is hampered by a paucity of fossil and genomic data, as
              well as variability in prior divergence time estimates. Here we
              use linkage disequilibrium and diversity-based statistics,
              optimized for rapid, complex demographic inference to
              discriminate among such models. We infer detailed demographic
              models for populations across Africa, including representatives
              from eastern and western groups, as well as 44 newly whole-genome
              sequenced individuals from the Nama (Khoe-San). Despite the
              complexity of African population history, contemporary population
              structure dates back to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5. The
              earliest population divergence among contemporary populations
              occurs 120-135ka, between the Khoe-San and other groups. Prior to
              the divergence of contemporary African groups, we infer
              long-lasting structure between two or more weakly differentiated
              ancestral Homo populations connected by gene flow over hundreds
              of thousands of years (i.e. a weakly structured stem). We find
              that weakly structured stem models provide more likely
              explanations of polymorphism that had previously been attributed
              to contributions from archaic hominins in Africa. In contrast to
              models with archaic introgression, we predict that fossil remains
              from coexisting ancestral populations should be morphologically
              similar. Despite genetic similarity between these populations, an
              inferred 1--4\% of genetic differentiation among contemporary
              human populations can be attributed to genetic drift between stem
              populations. We show that model misspecification explains
              variation in previous divergence time estimates and argue that
              studying a suite of models is key to robust inferences about deep

               differences are large. Studies of allele frequencies do not
               support this view, but they have not been sufficient to rule it
               out either. We analyzed human molecular diversity at 109 DNA
               markers, namely 30 microsatellite loci and 79 polymorphic
               restriction sites (restriction fragment length polymorphism
               loci) in 16 populations of the world. By partitioning genetic
               variances at three hierarchical levels of population
               subdivision, we found that differences between members of the
               same population account for 84.4\% of the total, which is in
               excellent agreement with estimates based on allele frequencies
               of classic, protein polymorphisms. Genetic variation remains
               high even within small population groups. On the average,
               microsatellite and restriction fragment length polymorphism loci
               yield identical estimates. Differences among continents
               represent roughly 1/10 of human molecular diversity, which does
               not suggest that the racial subdivision of our species reflects

              are grounded in simple assumptions that are inherent in the
              modern evolutionary synthesis (MES), which was developed in the
              1930s, 1940s and 1950s. The MES was framed in the context of
              Mendelian genetic transmission enhanced by the Fisherian view of
              the way discretely inherited genes determine continuously
              quantitative phenotypes. The statistical models that are used to
              estimate and interpret genetic contributions to human
              phenotypes-including behavioural traits-are constructed within
              the framework of the MES. Variance analysis constitutes the main
              tool and is used under this framework to characterize genetic
              inheritance, and hence determination of phenotypes. In this
              essay, we show that cultural inheritance, when incorporated into
              models for the determination of phenotypes, can sharply reduce
              estimates of the genetic contribution to these phenotypes.
              Recognition of the importance of non-genetic transmission of many
              human traits is becoming ever more necessary to prevent
              regression to the debates of the 1970s and 1980s concerning

              behavior will ensure similar results in different laboratories.
              We evaluated this supposition by conducting behavioral tests with
              identical apparatus and test protocols in independent
              laboratories. Eight genetic groups of mice, including equal
              numbers of males and females, were either bred locally or shipped
              from the supplier and then tested on six behaviors simultaneously
              in three laboratories (Albany, NY; Edmonton, AB; Portland, OR).
              The behaviors included locomotor activity in a small box, the
              elevated plus maze, accelerating rotarod, visible platform water
              escape, cocaine activation of locomotor activity, and ethanol
              preference in a two-bottle test. A preliminary report of this
              study presented a conventional analysis of conventional measures
              that revealed strong effects of both genotype and laboratory as
              well as noteworthy interactions between genotype and laboratory.
              We now report a more detailed analysis of additional measures and
              view the data for each test in different ways. Whether mice were
              shipped from a supplier or bred locally had negligible effects
              for almost every measure in the six tests, and sex differences
              were also absent or very small for most behaviors, whereas
              genetic effects were almost always large. For locomotor activity,
              cocaine activation, and elevated plus maze, the analysis
              demonstrated the strong dependence of genetic differences in
              behavior on the laboratory giving the tests. For ethanol
              preference and water escape learning, on the other hand, the
              three labs obtained essentially the same results for key
              indicators of behavior. Thus, it is clear that the strong
              dependence of results on the specific laboratory is itself
              dependent on the task in question. Our results suggest that there
              may be advantages of test standardization, but laboratory
              environments probably can never be made sufficiently similar to
              guarantee identical results on a wide range of tests in a wide
              range of labs. Interpretations of our results by colleagues in
              neuroscience as well as the mass media are reviewed. Pessimistic
              views, prevalent in the media but relatively uncommon among
              neuroscientists, of mouse behavioral tests as being highly
              unreliable are contradicted by our data. Despite the presence of
              noteworthy interactions between genotype and lab environment,
              most of the larger differences between inbred strains were
              replicated across the three labs. Strain differences of moderate
              effects size, on the other hand, often differed markedly among
              labs, especially those involving three 129-derived strains.

              strains of maze-bright and maze-dull rats are different
              psychological ``types'' of rats, and to identify specific
              behavior tendencies within each strain's maze-learning
              performance. 30 measures were obtained of learning, emotionality,
              activity, and other behaviors for samples of 10 Brights, 10
              Dulls, and 15 rats of a median strain. The mean correlation of
              Brights with Dulls (an ``inverted'' correlational analysis) was
              -.19, whereas members within each strain showed high and positive
              correlations with one another (+.59, +.53). These results are
              interpreted as strongly confirming the type hypothesis. A study
              of the behavior profiles indicated that Brights are food-driven,
              economical of distance, low in motivation to escape from water,
              and timid in response to open spaces; while Dulls are relatively
              disinterested in food, average or better in water motivation, and
              timid of mechanical apparatus features. The conclusion was drawn
              that brightness and dullness in the original Tryon Maze may be
              accounted for in large part by such motivational and emotional
              patterns. Certain basic ``cognitive'' tendencies may also be
              different in the two strains. 24-item bibliography. (PsycINFO
